Today we summarize recent roster news and share updated thoughts on who might get cut ahead of the regular season. We then discuss what defines success this season and why we should change our perspective from "Victor or bust" to "Guanantee a franchise-level player".

## Roster moves

*   Saben Lee cut from Jazz
*   Micah Potter signed to two-way
*   Darryl Morsell signed, then released
*   Jeenathan Williams signed (summer league UJ participant)

Some of these peripheral moves have no bearing on the regular season roster. Mostly just maneauvering so the team gets control and can have them participate on the Salt Lake City Stars.

Who else is slotted to get cut?

*   Udoka Azubuike still hasn't debuted in the preseason
*   Jared Butler just hasn't looked good outside of the scrimmage (saw how well that worked for Lee)
*   I think NAW stays and I'm coming around a bit
*   Don't know about that final one

## Projections & defining success

Projections:

*   Draft Kings: 24.5 (5th highest lotto odds)
*   Hardwood Knocks: 25 (5th highest lotto odds)
*   ESPN: 34.9 (6th highest lotto odds)
*   Tankathon: (5th highest lotto odds)

Best guess is we land in the 3-7 range. Does that match expectations for a successful season?

How should we define success:

Lose a  bunch of games?

Can't just be lose games.

Can we balance:

*   Developing winning habits
*   Mentoring our young guys
*   Lots of playing time for young guys
*   See what we have
*   Let Hardy make mistakes
*   Still lose a lot of games

I believe so and I believe that's the plan
