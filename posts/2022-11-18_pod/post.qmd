## What's actually bad/good?

*   Lead up
    -   2021-22 season
    -   Redesigned stadium
    -   Unofficial graphics
    -   Font-gate
    -   Black & white
*   The colors
    -   Black, white, yellow
        *   Yellow was a concession mandated by the league
        *   Symbolism
            -   White/Black: piano keys
            -   Yellow: spotlight on greatest performers
![Color Symbolism](colors-explanation.png)
*   Purple is Back
    -   Release video
        *   Starts and ends with purple
        *   68 secs purple, 33 secs of new kit
    -   Salt Lake Tribune reported it was a last minute add when fanbase reactions were poor
![Purple is Back](purple-is-back.png)
*   The court
    -   Angled light flooring
    -   Silver accents
    -   Black and yellow point work
*   New note/primary logo
    -   Primary logo doesn't feature "Jazz" or "Utah"
    -   No accent mark, thinker stem, different angle
        *   More identifiable and easier for digital use
*   The fonts
    -   Lots of block, capitalized letters
    -   Weird, mismatched size and width
![Odd Font](weird-font.png)
*   The jerseys
    -   Association: white, black lettering, silver & yellow trim
    -   Icon: yellow, black lettering, silver trim
    -   Statement: black, yellow lettering, black trim
*   The merchandise
    -   A lot of meh, basic, "IT IS YOUR BIRTHDAY." energy
    -   The overly yellow is legitimately tough to like
    -   A lot of the purple is nice
    -   The black and white, highlighting the note, is pretty cool

## Did the team use good practice?

*   Came in wanting to fix an "identiy crisis"
*   Reports of "echo chamber", "affirmative action" type focus groups
*   Lots of talk of Ryan's personal project
*   Expediting the process with half steps
*   Last second "purple" angle
*   Awful PR
*   Ryan admitting there's stuff he didn't like

## What's the legacy of this era?

*   How does this branding era go down relative to the others?
*   Can the Jazz ever achieve a consistent identity?
*   Will fan base pressure provoke a change *this* big?

## How would we see it evolve?

Assume Nike insists the team continue with a 90% facsimile of what the current brand is, what do you change?

When Jazz have their next opportunity to rebrand, what do you do?
