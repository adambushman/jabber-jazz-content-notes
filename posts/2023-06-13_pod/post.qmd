## Draft Targets at 9

Jarace Walker

*   Like
    -   Passing
    -   Defense
    -   Enough creation potential for me
*   Fit 
    -   Love the front court trio of Lauri, Jarace, Walker
    -   Elite defense immediately
    -   Run some PnR, operate at the nail, spot up in the corner
*   Odds
    -   Currently no industry board has him lower than 7

Cam Whitmore

*   Like
    -   Athleticism
    -   Creation
    -   The potential
*   Fit
    -   Could operate at the 2 or 3, complimenting Lauri well
    -   Jazz need creation
*   Odds
    -   Currently no industry board has him lower than 8

Ausar Thompson

*   Like
    -   Feel and instincts for the game
    -   Balanced skills and complimentary style
    -   Not a concern on the shot
*   Fit
    -   The athleticism and speed compliments our finishers
    -   The passing and defense are sore needs
    -   Maybe he develops into a lead G which would be monumental
*   Odds
    -   Currently no industry board has him lower than 8

Anthony Black

*   Like
    -   The defense
    -   Floor raiser with his connective style on offense
*   Fit
    -   Passing and defense is what we need; position size is great
    -   PnR with Kessler; hitting Markkanen on cuts
*   Odds
    -   Industry boards mock him between 6 and 10

Taylor Hendricks

*   Like
    -   The shot and rim protection combo is awesome
    -   Enough athleticism to round out a nice frontcourt trio
*   Fit
    -   Compliments Markkanen and Kessler except for self-creation
*   Odds
    -   Industry boards mock him between 6 and 14
