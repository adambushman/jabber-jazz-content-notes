## Team strengths & weaknesses

Jazz are 14-11; big win streaks, big losing streaks; what is this team?

Strengths:

*   We're exceptional offensively: 4th in NBA. How?
    -   Great shot advantage team: 
        *   3rd largest 3P advantage (T3PA - O3PA)
        *   5th largest SS advantage
    -   Good shooting team:
        *   4th in eFG% advantage
        *   5th largest 3P% advantage 
    -   Fairly neutral on offensive possession swing
        *   min(TOV) and max(OREB): 12th
    -   We're good at transition but rarely get out
    -   Our 5-out groups are special (no Vando, no Kessler)
        *   565 poss, +9 diff (91%tile), 120.7 offense
    -   It gets tough when we aren't 5-out but also lack interior size

Weaknesses:

*   We're pretty poor defensively: 26th
    -   We defend the shot decent and we force bad shots generally
        *   We're 24th in Rim Freq advantage
    -   On defense, it's worst with possessions
        *   max(TOV) and min(OREB): 26th
    -   We can't stop or prevent opposing teams from running
    -   We struggle with the teams with size in the middle
        *   PHI, PHX, LAC

To be clear, IMO, we're a play-in team, sneak into playoffs if we keep at this all season long. That's not a contender. That's an invitation for Luka, Steph, Jokic, or Booker to wipe the floor with us in a 1-4, 2-4 series loss.


## Trade potential for Utah

*   Rumors [link](https://hoopshype.com/team/utah-jazz/)
    -   Jazz want to trade Rudy Gay
        *   This is a bit of "no duh"
            -   Efficiency is awful (-12.7% rTS)
            -   Minutes ahead of Fontecchio & Agbaji
            -   Doesn't fit anything we're doing
            -   Worst BPM of any player with 100+ minutes
        *   Problems
            -   Currently injured (finger)
            -   Player option for next year ($6.5M)
        *   Options
            -   Just Gay? You're giving up a pick (no way you do that)
            -   Bigger deal? He can be a concession for something
            -   I don't know who'd even want him
    -   Jazz interested in John Collins
        *   Always made a lot of sense
            -   Stretchy 4, can shoot, good on the glass, young (25), athletic
            -   Discussed last couple years as available
        *   Asking price
            -   ATL asked for Markkanen...clearly that went no where
            -   If that's the required cost, he's staying in ATL another trade deadline
        *   Value I'd give up?
            -   Clarkson + Gay + BKN 1st
            -   ATL frees up some money since Clarkson will opt out; get another pick for flexibility
            -   UTA takes on the 4 year contract for Collins
    -   Jazz intent on keeping Clarkson, Markkanen; high price for Vanderbilt
        *   Markkanen is obvious
            -   Team control for two years after this one
            -   Young (25)
            -   Proving to be a great #2, possible All-Star this year
            -   Your development project
            -   Likely resign, max guy in 2025 offseason
        *   Clarkson is nuanced
            -   Cultural icon
            -   Will stay if we want him
            -   Will opt out and look for a 3 yr/$75M deal (19% of the cap)
                *   Probably impossible to trade afterward; 31 upon signing
            -   Has shown additional improvement, development (passing)
            -   Value I'd give up
                *   Mentioned the Collins trade
                *   Clarkson + '25 pick for Cameron Johnson + Saric (or Crowder)
                    -   Jazz extend Johnson (currently injured)
                    -   Suns can extend Clarkson (perhaps clears way for Crowder)
        *   Vanderbilt
            -   Such an amazing contract ($4M this year and next) at only age 23
            -   Will take an awesome offer
            -   Value I'd give up
                *   Vando + two-2nds for Jonathan Kuminga
                *   Vando + one-2nd + swap rights with BKN pick (ie if BKN pick is better than GSW, they get it)
*   Other ideas
    -   I've floated Jimmy Butler as a move to go all-in on Markkanen being good right now
        *   In a couple years, Markkanen is going to get $40M-$50M; that's 24-30% of the cap
        *   If it's too late to tank and you believe in Hardy and this group, you almost owe it to yourself to do it right
        *   Value I'd give up
            -   Start with: Sexton-THT-NAW + middle '23 1st, '25 1st, '27 1st
            -   Then try adding in another pick
            -   Then try Sexton-Beasley-Gay + 3 picks
    -   Deandre Ayton was available over the offseason, PHX matched IND offer, but he was always thought to eventually be on the move
        *   He's been bad-ish this year; biggest issue is he lacks impact on the game
        *   But he's 24, former #1 pick, locked up for 4 years at 25% of the cap, major cog for PHX getting to Finals
        *   He's lacked volume (only 11.7 TSA/gm this year), he's lacked empowerment and trust (Hardy's calling card)
        *   He's a #3 or a co-#2; have your frontcourt of the future
        *   Value I'd give up
            -   Olynyk + JC + Vando + two-1sts (BKN '23 and '25)
            -   May feel like a lot but you gotta beat other offers and match what PHX needs now
            -   JC is opting out, they may just move on from Olynyk so possibly two rentals
        


## 3 past team comparisons for this year's Jazz

These are facsimiles from NBA past that shed insights into what *could* be in store for the Jazz. They are stylistic comparisons.

We'll stay away from drawing exact conclusions and instead just consider them as potential future paths the franchise may traverse.

### 2011-12 Denver Nuggets

Timeline:

*   Traded Carmelo Anthony -> NYK in the offseason
    -   2 firsts, 2 seconds, 1 swap
    -   Chandler, Mozgov, Felton, Gallinari, Koufos
    -   Cash
*   With a scrappy squad of no #1s, finished 6th and then 3rd in West
*   Subsequent finishes
    -   11th in West
    -   12th in West
*   Never completely bottomed out
    -   Got lucky(?) with NYK being bad and turning into Jamal Murray
    -   Got lucky with Jokic in the 2nd round
    
Takeaways:

*   It's a cautionary tale of delaying the inevitable
*   It's also a case of building and losing value because you bought into it

### Post-Kawhi Spurs

Timeline:

*   Kawhi Leonard -> SAS in the offseason
    -   Demar DeRozan, Jakob Poeltl, 1st
*   Never tanked, until possibly this very season, yet...
    -   2018
        *   #18 - Lonnie Walker
    -   2019
        *   #19 - Luka Samanic
        *   #29 - Keldon Johnson
    -   2020
        *   #11 - Devin Vassell
    -   2021
        *   #12 - Josh Primo
    -   2022
        *   #9 - Jeremy Sochan
        *   #20 - Malachi Branham
        *   #25 - Blake Wesley
*   8 first round picks in 5 seasons
    -   Lucky with Johnson
    -   Unlucky with Primo
    -   Potential with Vassell, Sochan
    -   Rest are meh

Takeaways:

*   Jazz have 11 (minus 1) firsts in the next 5 seasons
*   Goal of high picks is to avoid being dependent on other teams missing on prospects
*   Spurs had a foundation but mid-picks never pushed them anywhere
    -   Similarly, Jazz have a foundation but lack that star

### 2013-14 Phoenix Suns

*   Went 48-34 after a single bad year post-Steve Nash
*   New coach in Jeff Hornacek
*   Good mix of youth and veterans
    -   Both Morris twins
    -   5th year Goran Dragic
    -   2nd year PJ Tucker
    -   3rd year Eric Bledsoe
*   Went on to have 6 straight losing seasons
    -   Lot of good players came and went: 
        *   Seth Curry
        *   TJ Warren
        *   Reggie Bullock
        *   Derrick Jones Jr.
    -   Swings and misses
        *   Marquisse Chriss
        *   Dragan Bender
        *   Josh Jackson

Takeaways:

*   PHX executed a transition and found some success but they lacked the super star
*   Even after drafting him (Booker) they lacked the development around him
*   They had bad luck (can happen, for sure)
*   They've still achieved more post-Steve Nash than Utah has post-Stockton/Malone in less time
    -   Always fun; heck no
    -   Quantity vs quality game
