## A Wild Deadline in Review

### Jazz Trade

*   Jazz made a trade...plenty of times we were mad they didn't
*   UTA, LAL, MIN
    -   Russell Westbrook + top-4 protected 1st -> UTA
    -   Mike Conley + Nickeil Alexander-Walker -> MIN
    -   D'Angelo Russell + Malik Beasley + Jarred Vanderbilt -> LAL
*   The good
    -   Excellent pick on the horizon
    -   Lots of guys get to really compete
        *   The guys weren't going to help in 2025-26
        *   Two 2nds weren't likely to help in 2025-26
        *   Even two heavily protected picks weren't likely to help in 2025-26
        *   But there's real upside for the LAL pick to help that team and their competitive seasons beyond
    -   Jazz improve their draft position
    -   Lakers should improve
    -   Wolves worse long term
    -   Cap space this summer
    -   Playing time for Agbaji, Sexton, Fontecchio
*   The bad
    -   Disappointing no true unprotected pick
        *   Wanted a pick each
        *   Real market was multiple 2nds
        *   Beasley could've fetched a heavily protected 1st
        *   Given all the picks we had, Jazz chose quantity over quality
    -   Andy Larsen broke down some of the pick value
        *   What the Jazz did was take some knowns for real upside down the road
    -   Best case scenario Wolves stay neutral
        *   Conley gives them the unique benefits they need
    -   Turns into a second if it doesn't convey
        *   I don't think the Jazz ever make the selection

    column_labels.font.weight = "bold", 
    
    column_labels.background.color = "#f6ee26", 
    row_group.padding = gt::px(0)
  )


```

### Playoff Race

*   PHX and DAL join MEM and DEN in an elite 4 rivaling the 4 in the East
*   BKN and LAL slide to the play-in

### Draft Outlook

*   TOR and POR do enough to fall to the back of the lottery
*   UTA slides to the front of the 2nd tier (after HOU, SAS, CHA, ORL, DET)
    -   IND is biggest competition here


## Future of the Utah Jazz

*   2023
    -   Draft
        *   538 projects UTA at 11th, MIN at 16th, PHI at 25th
    -   Free agency
        *   Jazz clear max + cap space for various avenues
*   Beyond
    -   2024: first of the years our pick conveys to OKC; probably keep it
    -   2025: 2 unprotected, last year Jazz are okay to convey to OKC
        *   Jazz will have decision on Markkanen
        *   Jazz hoping to begin their championship window
    -   2026: big swap year with CLE, MIN
        *   RFA on Kessler (likely extended prior) and Agbaji
    -   2027: 3 unprotected, 1 top-4 protected from LAL
        *   RFAs on the rookies in this draft
    -   2028: CLE swap
    -   2029: 2 unprotected, 1 top-5 protected from MIN
*   A lot of hope and potential
