Let's Jabber Jazz!


## Collective Bargaining Agreement

*   New CBA this year; some stuff is phased in but some is implemented immediately; all of it impact today's decisions
    *   We'll center discussion to "on court impact"
    *   Plenty of stuff related to players growing wealth and doing more that doesn't so much affect roster building
*   McCade to give us the cliff notes but strap in
    -   CBA tour guide
    -   Michael Scott meme: explain to me like I'm 5


## Impact of what we already know

*   Jazz signed 3 rookies
    -   Thoughts we wouldn't make all three picks
        *   Didn't trade back for 2nd round angle
    -   How does it affect cap room
    -   Roster spots/playing time
        *   Additional two-way
*   Jazz made the John Collins deal
    -   Bring on 2 guaranteed years, 1 player option worth $78.5M
    -   Send out Rudy Gay (1-yr, $7M); protected 2nd
*   THT opt-in
    -   Final year, $11M
    

## Remaining priorities

*   Navigate Jordan Clarkson's player option
    -   $14.3M
    -   Didn't extend last year so what's he looking for?
    -   Bird rights?
*   Point guard talent
    -   Jazz have a wealth of 2nd, 3rd string point guards
        *   THT, Dunn, George
        *   Also lots of combos: Clarkson, Agbaji, Sensabaugh
    -   Glaring weakness is competent passing
    
    
## Potential routes

How do we address these needs given the constraints?

*   RFA game
*   FA game
*   S&Ts
*   Trades


## Additional items

-   Rest of the league moves
