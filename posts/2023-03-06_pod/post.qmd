## The Tank is On

*   Recent article: no room or reason to tank
*   Still true: best case fall to 5, likely fall 7 or 8
*   Upstairs has blessed the tank
    -   Tony Jones has reported Jazz are giving run to the young players
    -   Clarkson, Sexton, and Markkanen have all sat out games with injury
    -   Toscano-Anderson, Dunn, Fontecchio, Horton-Tucker, Juzang all getting big run
*   No incentive to lose beyond this year
    -   Gotta get upside in the draft
*   At 7/8 spot, ~8% to win lottery (vs 14%) and ~32% to jump into top 4 (vs 52%)
    -   Poised to snag someone who falls (ie Ausar Thompson)
    -   Pick of a nice tier (ie Jarace Walker, Cam Whitmore, Anthony Black, Nick Smith Jr, etc)
    -   Possible to move up
        *   Amen Thompson slips to 5: our #7/8, BKN pick, & LAL '27 to move up
*   By embracing the tank to close, Jazz put themselves in position for options
    -   Whole point of the offseason


## League Factors Affecting the Draft

*   LAL: tied with UTA in standings
    -   28th in R-SOS
    -   4-2 since the trade deadline
    -   LeBron injury
*   OKC: Jazz two straight losses a big deal
    -   One more matchup in final week
*   MEM: unraveling at the seams
    -   Clark/Adams injury, Brooks/Morant suspension
    -   Play LAL x1, DAL x3, LAC x2, ORL x1, CHI x1, POR x1, NOP x1, OKC x1
    -   Could see extra losses to keep good teams away and bad teams better
*   POR: jekyll & hyde
    -   Lillard is putting up insane numbers
    -   Team just can't win; 9th in R-SOS


## Random Notes

*   All-Star Weekend
    -   Fun from a Jazz perspective
    -   Abysmal All-Star game
    -   Really good for the state
    -   Should have another one in <30 years
*   Quin coaching the Hawks
    -   Theory: greases the wheels on a future move
        *   ATL becomes third team to facilitate a trade
        *   UTA gets another bite at Collins in the summer
    -   Tough situation with Trae
*   Kessler Rookie Of the Month
    -   Top 3 rookie this year; guaranteed All-Rookie 1st Team
    -   Not on the same level as Paolo
*   ATTSN done, closing its doors
    -   Another media development
        *   NFL -> YouTube TV, MLS -> Apple TV
        *   Clippers direct service
    -   No fall back option
