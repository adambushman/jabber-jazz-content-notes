## Third 2023 NBA draft Look Ahead

Starter Questions:

*   What matters/doesn't matter to you different from consensus in prospect evaluation?
*   What are the player archtypes or skills that "break ties" for you?
*   What's the next fad you anticipate that defines player comps and skill set preferences?
