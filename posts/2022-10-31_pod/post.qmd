## Surprises thus far

*   Chemistry of the team
    -   Returning faces from last year's rotation: Conley, Clarkson, Gay
    -   Returning coaching staff: Jensen, Skeeter
    -   Given such turnover, didn't expect to see such cohesion
        *   Top 5 in assists
        *   13th in defense (CTG)
        *   #6 in clutch NRTG (min 10 total minutes)
*   Shooting performance
    -   Despite shooting talent, we've seen REALLY good luck
        *   Only 1 game where UTA 3PAs where fewer than their opponent
        *   Only 2 games where UTA 3P% was less than their opponent
    -   Without that kind of luck, we're looking more at a more realistic 3-4 record
*   "On the Same Page"
    -   #6 in smart shot freq advantage
    -   They've discovered some hierarchy and roles
            
## Interesting stats from key rotation members

Disclaimer: super small size theater

We'll try to stay away from inherently flawed stats as well

*   Lauri Markkanen
    -   Adjusted TSA/gm: +9.8 (last year +3.4)
    -   Adjusted TS%: -0.1% (last year +1.6%)
    -   Similar efficiency on increased volume? Heck yeah!
        *   27% on 3's while previous 1000 attempts resulted in 37%
*   Mike Conley
    -   Seems far more active defensively
        *   STL per 36: 1.6 (last year 1.7)
        *   DEFLECtIONS per 36: 2.4 (last year 2.6)
*   Jordan Clarkson
    -   Really prone to pass this season; has his eyes out and looking to playmake
    -   Potential assists per 36: 9.9 (last year 5.7)
*   Kelly Olynyk
    -   Putting together a similar start as he did in HOU, his best stretch ever
        *   HOU: 21.7 pts, 9.6 rbs, 4.7 ast, +10.2% per 75 poss
        *   UTA: 17.5 pts, 5.3 rbs, 4.7 ast, +13.8% per 75 poss
*   Malik Beasley
    -   Malik hit that game sealing 3 against Memphis but...
        *   Efficiency: 35.5% on C&S (down from 38.1%)
        *   Volume: 44.9% of shots as C&S3 (down from 60.4% last year)
*   Jarred Vanderbilt
    -   6.4 fouls per 75 possessions; leading the league (min 100 minutes played)
    -   Fouled out of 2 games this year; 3 games where playing time seriously affected
    -   Has to get that under control (last two games have been better: 2 & 3 fouls respectively)
*   Collin Sexton
    -   Big question: where is he realtive to 20-21?
        *   He's not there from a volume/role standpoint
    -   But what about rates?
        *   CLE: 25.5 pts, 3.3 rbs, 4.6 ast, +0.1% per 75 poss
        *   UTA: 22.9 pts, 5.4 rbs, 3.5 ast, +3.1% per 75 poss
*   Rudy Gay
    -   Much was made of Gay being unhappy last year
        *   But it appears his attitude is improving despite...
            -   USG: 16.5 (down from 19.3 last year)
            -   Min/gm: 16.8 (down from 18.9 last year)
*   Talen Horton-Tucker
    -   Rough, rough efficiency thus far: -12.5 rTS%
        *   Not a ton of reasons his game should ever translate to league average efficiency
*   Walker Kessler
    -   Creating significant issues for defenses at the rim
        *   Opponent Rim Freq: 32% w/o Kessler (38% w/)
        *   Opponent Rim FG%: 64% w/o Kessler (52% w/)
