Let's Jabber Jazz!


## Walker Kessler Craze

*   Timeline...
    -   Jazz trade for Walker
    -   Injury prevents any Summer League
    -   Immediate backup C in preseason, despite Zeller & Azubuike
    -   Carved out a consistent 15-20 min playing time
    -   Just finished a stretch of starting
*   Performance
    -   41 centers with 10 or fewer games started and 100 or more total minutes
        *   Walker rank...
        *   3rd in BPM
        *   4th in minutes
        *   7th in efficiency
        *   35th in usage
    -   Jazz with Kessler...
        *   ON: +5.0
        *   OFF: -1.7
    -   Jazz with Kessler starting...
        *   3-3
        *   4th best plus-minues (2nd among starters)
*   Walker is deserving to start sooner than later
    -   Kelly can take Vando's spot or come off bench
    -   Minutes can stay the same
    -   Hopefully he turns into Zubac role

## More John Collins Buzz

*   Shams Charania reported 
[3 team framework](https://twitter.com/TheRally/status/1607511261473816578?s=20&t=SiibjwZmm6HeVmtQdqFfFg) 
for a John Collins trade to Utah. Deal fell apart with UTah asking for multiple 1sts
*   Vanderbilt + Beasley -> PHX, Crowder + Shamet -> ATL, Collins + 1st -> UTA
*   Ainge should be asking for more
    -   Collins is lowest value
    -   Vando, Beas are peak value
*   PHX is making off here like a bandit
*   I'm bullish on Collins
    -   Would you rather have Collins or a late 1st? Collins
    -   Showed prior to Trae what he was capable of offensively
    -   Showed in ECF why he can be a valuable rotation piece
    -   This year is just a ton of bad luck
*   Beas is a guy I want to keep
    -   You'll be looking for his skillset eventually
    -   Only 25

## Leveraging Lauri

*   Lauri is going bonkers
    -   +9.0% rTS is crazy elite
    -   Only Jokic and Durant exceed his efficiency for +24% USG and 1000+ minutes played
    -   Making 44% of his 3's on 7 a game
        *   Jazz need to plumb that like crazy, hopefully to get closer to 10 attempts per game
*   Bad news is that usage is low and fit for #2
    -   He's got a super low % of FGM unassisted
    -   He struggles to get the ball and create for himself late in games or when defenses zero in on him
    -   That's his development in the offseason
        *   No shame if he's not that type of player
            -   Basicaly he's year 2 Michael Porter Jr. with defense
            -   Will be selected as an All-Star, in all likelihood

## Widening Draft Tier 2

*   All indications are that tier 2 of the NBA draft is getting wider
    -   Anthony Black impressing
    -   GG Jackson ascending
    -   Ausar Thompson falling a little
*   Josh Roberts (from last pod) 1-8 as All-Star potential and 9-13 as starter level
*   There appears to be a lot of volatility in this range. A guy who may be slotted for 6 could end up at 10
    -   This is good news for the Jazz, a team who best case scenario is in the middle here and worst case at the back end

## Positioning

*   At 19-18 the Jazz are almost halfway through the season and truly find themselves in "the middle"
*   Really whichever way the Jazz want to go, there's a path to it
    -   3.5 games out of a top 7 seed
    -   Currently slotted for the play in
    -   1 game out of a top 6 seed for the Western Conference
*   Looking ahead with the projection systems, if Jazz want
    -   A #3 odds, that's 25 wins; 0.133 win rate
    -   A #7 odds, that's 35 wins; 0.355 win rate
    -   A #10 odds, that's 39 wins; a 0.444 win rate
    -   A #14 odds, that's 42 wins, a 0.511 win rate
    -   Jazz have a 0.400 win rate since Nov. 9
