## Trade Talk Is Afoot

These ideas came from the Lowe Post podcast. Zach Lowe and Bobby Marks of ESPN discussed these frameworks.

We'll comment from a Jazz fan and team perspective.

*   Trade #1
    -   UTA & BKN (made O'Neale trade in offseason)
        *   Jarred Vanderbilt to BKN
        *   DayRon Sharpe, Kessler Edwards, 2027 PHI 1st top 8 protected
    -   Breakdown
        *   DayRon Sharpe, 1 year in, 29th pick, traditional big, kind of an unknown (570 minutes)
        *   Kessler Edwards, 1 year in, 44th pick, 6-8 wing, good shooter, not a ton else
    -   Mostly this trade is about the pick Edwards
        *   Many have circled Embiid as a guy to ask out; Harden is talking about going back to HOU; pick could be pretty decent
        *   Edwards is a type who could flourish into a nice backup forward
    -   In a vacuum, I probably do this; I would prefer other deals but I'm low on Vando's fit with Kessler
*   Trade #2
    -   UTA & MEM
        *   Danny Green, filler, and a pick to UTA
        *   Malik Beasley to MEM
    -   Breakdown
        *   Danny Green fully guarantee on Jan 10, UFA next season
        *   Filler is likely a young player with some promise but non of MEM top 8
        *   Pick is likely MEM own, protected somehow
    -   Mostly this trade is about freeing up more cap space next year and getting a pick
        *   Next year's class has guys like Grant, Porzingis, VanVleet
    -   To me, this doesn't make enough sense;
        *   Beasley is a piece you keep, IMO; you'll need his skillset anyways and is unlikely to lose any value anytime soon
        *   Someone bulls you over? Sure, but not for this deal IMO
*   Trade #3
    -   UTA & GSW
        *   Kelly Olynyk to GSW
        *   James Wiseman + filler (discussed 2-1s) to UTA
    -   Breakdown
        *   Wiseman #2 pick, hardly any playing time between high school, college, NBA, and G-League
        *   Shows flashes
        *   The other guy isn't likely to have any value (not a core piece to GSW)
    -   Basically this trade is about buying crazy low on a former top pick
        *   In theory, this is the type of thing teams in our position gotta do
    -   I wouldn't do this trade, though. I think it's very important for Utah to follow a LAC model at C
        *   Traditional rim protector for 30 mins a night and 5-out able the rest of the time
*   Trade #4
    -   UTA & NOP
        *   Malik Beasley to NOP
        *   2025 MIL pick + filler
            -   The filler was never much talked about but probably includes a combo of Garrett Temple, Devonte' Graham, Jaxon Hayes, Kira Lewis Jr.
            -   2025 pick probably ages out Brook Lopez maybe Middleton leaves; still I think it's in the 20's
    *   Basically again it's parts and a late pic
        -   As is, I'm not doing it, again because I believe at 25 Malik fits Kessler, Markkanen, and new draft picks
        -   But, if it was Dyson Daniels or Trey Murphy III and parts (no pick), yes I'd do it in a heartbeat


## Markkanen Is an All-Star

Markkanen will be an All-Star this year; it's done, IMO, and I'll tell you why

*   His line is absurd: 24.5 pts, 8.4 rbs, 1.9 ast, 1.8 tov on +9.6% rTS
    -   Just take the pts, rbs, ast line adjusted worst by 10%
    -   14 player seasons before this year did it: 12 made the All-Star game
        *   Dan Issel did it on +4.0% rTS (0.327 win rate by All-Star)
        *   Antawn Jamison did it on +0.5% rTS (0.207 win rate by All-Star)
    -   Jazz are 0.487 win rate
*   He's in the elite tier of efficiency
    -   Only Jokic and Durant have a better TS% than Markkanen with more than 16.5 TSA/game
    -   Guys right behind him? Curry, Davis, Williamson, Embiid...all All-Stars
*   Utah Jazz are hosting in SLC
    -   Over the past 25 All-Star games in cities with a host NBA team, 17 had at least one representative 
    -   Teams/years that didn't?
        *   Atlanta in 2021: 0.444 win rate at All-Star break
        *   Chicago in 2020: 0.345
        *   Los Angeles in 2018: 0.469
        *   Denver in 2005: 0.453
        *   Atlanta in 2003: 0.388
        *   Washington DC in 2001: 0.245
        *   Golden State in 2000: 0.255
        *   New York in 1998: 0.543
    -   These teams didh't have a guy like Markkanen and many were dumpster fire
        *   Barring big trades, Jazz are likely above 0.500 by the break 

## Ochai Sighting

Finally we saw Ochai play actual, high leverage minutes:

*   Against Houston
    -   First stint was 4:55, Jazz were a -3
    -   Second stint was 12:44, all of the 4th, Jazz were a +11
    -   Finished with 11 points, 1 rebound; 3-4 from 3
        *   Hardy said he'd get more time and this was a good sign
        *   Looked like he knew more where to be and what was going on
        *   Still didn't impact the game a ton outside of scoring
    -   There was a reason he was drafted #14 and also a reason he hasn't seen the floor. One game doesn't change any of that, not would a bad game have. Let's keep evaluating.
