## Intro to Draft

Idea:

If we had to "split the Jazz", what assets would new GMs Riley and McCade want for their respective futures?

Process & Rules:

*   McCade & Riley take turns drafting; I will host and moderate
*   Snake draft; Riley with the first pick, then double picks rest of the way until a final Riley pick
*   60 sec to make your pick meanwhile the other can comment on why they made their picks
*   Throughout we'll stop and quickly assess surprises
*   48 possible selections; McCade & Riley will select 20 each
*   Considerations for each pick:
    -   Players: cap usage, age, team control, etc.
        -   Everyone on training camp roster minuts two-way
    -   Picks: true value, when/how convey and lifetime value, etc.
        -   All 1sts and 2nds, even swaps
    -   Other: opportunity costs, etc.
        -   Cap space and trade exceptions
*   McCade & Riley can go as in depth/surface level on the details

## Let's Draft
