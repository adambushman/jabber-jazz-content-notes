## John Collins to the Jazz

The deal:

*   The deal
    -   Jazz receive John Collins
    -   Hawks receive Rudy Gay, protected future 2nd round pick
        *   MEM's pick which conveys if 31-45 (so a good 2nd, actually...but a second)
*   Why?
    -   ATL
        *   They are in cap hell; need to shed money for extensions and future compliance with CBA
        *   John's role and impact have reduced as their approach has changed
    -   UTA 
        *   Needs to have 90% of the cap in rostered salaries by start of the season
        *   Gets off Gay, bets on a younger talent
*   Announced yesterday about an hour before the press conference
*   Can't be completed until after the "next season" begins
    -   Cap space is opened up via Russell Westbrook, others


John Collins:

*   6'9", 226 lb forward; 6 years in the NBA, turns 26 right before the season starts
*   One of the more athletic, physically impressive players in the league
*   His career has been a seesaw, inflected most drastically by the hire of Nate McMillan
    -   Pre-McMillan
        *   John was drafted 19th out of Wake Forrest
        *   He was selected for the All-Rookie team with Donovan that year
        *   Stats
    -   The reign of McMillan
        *   Nate was hire mid-season, 2020-21
        *   Stats
*   Awesome in transition, cuts, PnR
*   Improved as defender, passer, non-scoring contributor

Utah Jazz:

*   Jazz had to use their cap space somehow and bet on a guy who has a lot of value rebuild potential
*   Fits what Utah wants to do:
    -   Athletic, big, long, strong
    -   Plays with and without the ball
    -   Can work inside out
    -   Can contribute on both ends
*   Immediately
    -   Markkanen, Collins, Kessler starting frontcourt
    -   Hendricks, Olynyk off the bench
    -   Samanic, Jones 3rd string
*   Impact
    -   Hendricks likley isn't starting at all this year
        *   Shouldn't impact his minutes
        *   Opened my eyes to the possibility UTA sees Hendricks as a 3/4
    -   Olynyk won't be with UTA long term but the team could slow play and experiment most the year

The Future:

*   John is owned $75M over the coming 3 years
    -   Works out to ~19%, 18%, and 17% of the cap
    -   Comes off books for Kessler, Agbaji extensions
*   Great salary for trade matching
    -   If UTA is make a big offer for a star, this is perfect to be the meat of matching salary
