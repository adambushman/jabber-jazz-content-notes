## Pick Status

*   Current positions
    -   FiveThirtyEight says...
        *   UTA: 10
        *   MIN: 13 (tie)
        *   HOU/BKN/PHI: 28
*   Complications
    -   MIN injuries
        *   Edwards, Towns, Conley (coming)
    -   UTA plan
        *   Interpretation
            -   Decide player status based on health and opponent;
            -   Upon tipoff, all out for the win
    -   Additional tankers
        *   POR, IND have rested big portions of the rotation and considering player "shut down"
    -   Time
        *   LAL and LeBron
        *   NOP, Zion and Ingram
*   Takeaways
    -   Only real way to ensure competitive draft position is your strategy
    -   Jazz employed a strategy VERY late
    -   No other teams have a Markkanen, Walker, and Hardy so its hard to tank
*   Does it matter?
    -   #7 and #10 are in fair play
        *   Requires like 2 wins rest of the way
        *   Win lotto: 11% vs 14%
        *   Jump to top 4: 46% vs 52%
        *   This is the end of a high upside draft range with some volatility
    -   #10 and #11
        *   Win lotto: 4% vs 14%
        *   19% vs 52%
        *   This is a draft range that is similar talent wise into the late teens
    -   Why have a high pick?
        *   Depend on the fewest teams to "misevaluate" 
    -   Impact?
        *   Affects ceiling
        *   Doesn't mean the Jazz won't be good


## Thoughts on the Nucleaus

*   Lauri Markkanen
    -   Best combo of dunks + threes in the league
    -   Rivals only Kevin Durant all-time
    -   Starting to get All-NBA buzz
        *   A complication for the "tanking"
    -   Definitely a top 15 season
        *   Doesn't mean a top 15 player
        *   Ringer put him at 28
        *   Siakam, Haliburton, Brown, Sabonis, Young, Irving, etc. all done it longer than Markkanen
*   Walker Kessler
    -   Drafted 22nd, 30+ games started
    -   Top 3 rookie season
    -   Where does he rank among starting centers?
        *   Back in December I put him in the bottom 11 tier with Plumlee, Nurkic, etc.
            -   Still hadn't started a game, just 16 mpg
        *   Now?
            -   Tier 3, right about average
            -   Massive win for the franchise
            
|Tier|Centers|
|-----:|:-----------------------------------|
|1|Embiid, Jokic|
|2|Adebayo, Turner, Gobert, Lopez, Allen, Horford, Ayton|
|3|Zubac, Adams, Capela, Carter Jr., Powell, Claxton| Valanciunas, Duren, Sengun, Poeltl, Porzingis|
|4|Vucevic, Plumlee, Len, Hartenstein, Bryant, Koloko, Muscala, Nurkic, Wiseman|
          
            
*   Ochai Agbaji
    -   Performing real well of late, showing some expanded skills
    -   Non-straight line drive, movement shooting, finishes at the rim, defensive activity
    -   Gaining that confidence of where to be, what to do
        *   Used to just run from corner to corner
    -   At 37% from 3, 147 attempts
        *   39%, 126 attempts
    -   Tony Jones, The Athletic
        *   Jazz high on Agbaji, definitely part of the core
        *   They see him as a 2; lean toward a 3 in the draft


## March Madness Notes

*   Cason Wallace
    -   Showed everything in that K State game
        *   Defense, creation, finishing, toughness, shot makingn
        *   Not the high upside guy but the type who coaches will trust and has a great foundation in everything
*   Gradey Dick
    -   Saw the contrasts:
        *   vs Howard you see why he's a late lotto pick
        *   vs Arkansas you see why the upside is questionable
    -   Ultimately he's going to be dependend on teammates and coaches to leverage him in the scheme
*   Anthony Black
    -   Just locked up Gradey Dick; made him a non-factor
    -   Feels like he doesn't have the leway to get his usage up
        *   Holding back offensively
        *   Will need a franchise who encourages and believes in his outside shot
*   Jarace Walker
    -   Houston is geared around Sasser, for good or bad
        *   Jarace doesn't get the touches or the shot volume but impacts things
        *   You get him in a situation where a team begs him to shine offensively will be good
    -   Integral to the Auburn comeback
        *   High level defensively; 6 blocks and a lot of transition disruption
*   Brandon Miller
    -   Morphs for what is needed; didn't need to explode vs Corpus Christi
    -   Shined on both ends vs Maryland
*   Nick Smith Jr.
    -   Just don't "feel his impact"
    -   Workouts will be crucial for him
*   Keyonte George
    -   Had "duds" in both games, really
*   Nice showings
    -   Terquavion Smith, Dereck Lively II, Jalen-Hood Schifino, Dariq Whitehead
    -   Kyle Filipowski


## Offseason Question Marks

*   A lot of the buzz is the Jazz achieve contention again in 2025/26 via trade
    -   With all the picks in tow, they're uniquely positioned to land the next available guy
    -   Who is that?
        *   Many talk about Luka if but he and a handful of others are made available, they pick where they go
        *   Could be Lillard or Butler but that's a pretty short term approach
    -   Fans have a unique list: young, star, team control, fit
        *   But also must be gettable, healthy, etc.
    -   My personal theory
        *   LaMelo Ball is the guy that balances a lot of that
        *   I like the fit with Markkanen, Kessler, and Agbaji
    -   Other theories
        *   Jaylen Brown
            -   Buzz of discontent in BOS
            -   Ainge reached for him in the draft, Hardy was "his guy" as a coach
            -   IMO, it requires a three team deal
            -   Love the fit, however
