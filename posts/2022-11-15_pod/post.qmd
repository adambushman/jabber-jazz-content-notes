## Trader Danny's Dilemma

Jazz at 10-5, with every win, approach decision time more, more quickly:

*   FiveThirtyEight projects #7 odds is 36 wins: Jazz need to go 0.388 rest of the way
*   FiveThirtyEight projects #14 odds is 41 wins: Jazz need to go 0.462 rest of the way

3 Options Danny & FO have to weigh:

*   Trade the vets, hit the tank
*   Steady as she goes
*   Make a move to chase contention


### Trade the vets, hit the tank

Concerns:

*   Vibes are good; does that create issues culturally?
    -   Conley wants to stay, not uproot his family
    -   Clarkson has become the cultural icon of the franchise
    -   Markkanen's talked about "the noise"
*   Are there deals to be made?
    -   Issues in the offseason with Conley's partial guarantee
    -   Sure, reported markets for Clarkson, Beasley...but for positive value? Assets?
    -   Most of the time, takes a while to make deals: eligibility dates, etc.
*   Other considerations
    -   Finances
    -   Fanbase excitement
    -   All-Star game

### Steady as she goes

Concerns:

*   We aren't really a contender
    -   No real #1 guy
    -   Lack of rim deterrence
    -   Scouting is catching up; book on the Jazz is getting out
    -   Injuries are inevitable (Conley)
*   Middle-class bound
    -   Jazz are often outside of the contender class but rarely first in line for top, incoming talent


Most likely outcome:

*   Main goal was figuring out what the Jazz have; there's still some work to do there
*   MIN being toxic, BKN being combustible, and PHI being jekyll & hyde gives the impression there's enough in the aggregate
*   A lot of equity with the organization and fanbase by letting it ride out


### Make a move to chase contention

Concerns:

*   Jazz have all the mid-tier guys; "upgrade" is going to take a great player
    -   Who out there is available?
*   Who fits the bill
    -   Kevin Durant
    -   Luka Doncic
    -   Most will require a trade request
*   Can the Jazz execute fast enough?
    -   Deals at the deadline are for NEXT season



## Upgrade Idea

What to look for in an "upgrade"?

*   Under contract for a while
*   Playoff and maybe Finals experience
*   History as a top 15 guy
*   Fits the team's culture/identity
*   Addresses areas of weakness and fits positionally
*   Is actually available

To me, that's Jimmy Butler!

The trade:

*   Butler -> UTA
*    Sexton, Beasley, ~4 1st picks (2 unprotected) -> MIA
    -   MIA: comfortably below tax this year, potentially get out of tax next year'
        *   MIA is disappointing this year: 
        *   Bill Simmons Pod: are the Heat done?
            -   7-7 record; eeked out win over PHX; Bam/Lowry hot and cold
        *   Jimmy's not "available", just as Gobert wasn't
    -   UTA: stays just below the tax this year
    -   Other ways to change slightly with players and picks

Why does Jimmy make sense?

*   Under contract for 3 more years; suddenly you have a 3 yr window
    -   By 2026 offseason (UTA-CLE-MIN swap year), Jazz transition again to new era
*   Playoff & Finals experience
    -   97 career games
*   History of a top 15 guy
    -   SI Top 100: last year ranked 11, this year ranked 10
    -   Averaging 21 pts, 6 rbs, 6 ast on +0.3 rTS; 18 TSA/gm (Lauri is at 14, by comparison; Doncic at 25)
*   Fits the team's culture/identity
    -   Elite scorer: consistently positive rTS%
    -   Elite play maker: +25 AST% past four seasons (Conley career avg: 29%)
    -   Terrific size and perimeter defense
        *   Active rebounder and disruptor
    -   He's always about going hard, extra, etc.
*   Addresses areas of weakness and fits positionally
    -   Slots into the starting 2 spot
    -   Mid-range scoring (need in playoffs) and gets to the line
    -   Rotation: 
        *   Starters: Conley, Butler, Markkanen, Vanderbilt, Olynyk
        *   Bench: Horton-Tucker, Clarkson, Gay, Kessler
*   Is actually available
    -   MIA has started super slow and disappointed
    -   Committed to Bam & Herro
    -   In MIA, with picks and cap space, they can get anyone
        *   2024 offseason after Lowry is gone, they could sign or trade for a ton of amazing players

There's absolutely risks with such a deal.

UTA discovered they have a #2 and a handful of #3-#4 options post-Rudy/Don trades.

Jazz can make this deal and still be positive in draft capital.


## 5 Luke-warm Takes

Hot takes are a bit overrated.

Ultimately a good opportunity to share stuff on my mind!

1.    Kessler needs ~22 mpg
      *   Hardy has him at 15 minutes
      *   Olynyk is really good but...
      *   Kessler has earned more time
      *   Kessler is impacting the game at a high level and addresses unique weaknesses
2.    Collin's a better player than 3rd year Sexton
      *   We (including me) talk about Collin getting back to that level
      *   But we don't want that production with those habits
      *   I'd prefer this production with better habits
          -   Better discipline defensively
          -   This approach to efficiency (FTAr & 3PAr)
          -   This activity on the glass
          -   This accountability
      *   It's still not great but he's developing better process
3.    The collective approach offensively works in the regular season but not the playoffs
      *   Our top player (Lauri) is far below the usage of other stars
      *   This distribution of offensive role, efficiency, etc. is really difficult to beat
          -   Any given night anyone can produce
          -   Limited scouting reports & preparation
              *   Saw this in the PHI & WAS games; scouting can blow up a team of a lot of "good"
      *   Come playoffs, that model doesn't work
          -   Sure, you need good guys to punish loading up on the star
          -   But with playoff prep, switching defenses, you need the star who can handle high usage and punish good matchups
      *   That's what spells trouble for Utah
          -   Likely playoff matchups
              *   DAL: Luka
              *   PHX: Booker
              *   DEN: Jokic
4.    The opponent 3P shooting isn't THAT crazy
      *   Zach Lowe has talked about it a few times on his podcast
      *   Last year's league low was 33.9% (Jazz currently at 32.5%)
          -   Opponents make 6 more 3's, Jazz are at last year's low
          -   Someone has to be the best team and so far it's not blatantly out of the ordinary
      *   Some data points to evaluate process
              *   Jazz are allowing the lowest opponent frequency
              *   Jazz allowing the 2nd fewest corner 3's (the one's you want)
              *   Jazz allowing the fewest C&S 3's (those are the ones you want)
              *   Jazz allowing the 3rd fewest WIDE open 3's (6+ ft of space)
      *   Opponent 3P talent?? (past 3 year efficiency/volume data)
          -   Bottom 10: HOU, HOU, MEM, MEM, LAL, LAL, DAL, WAS
              *   Stroked against us? DEN, MEM, LAL
          -   Middle 10: DEN, DEN, ATL, PHI
          -   Top 10: MIN, NOP, LAC
      *   Upcoming??
          -   NYK: 15th
          -   PHX: 19th
          -   POR: 14th
      *   Jazz?? 8th in shooting talent
5.    Our starting lineup is fun but it's only average
      *   Think about it: no star, lots of good, modern style
      *   CTG: top lineups (100+ minutes)
          -   NBA best? Embiid + Maxey + PHI, no Harden: +33.4
          -   NBA worst? George + LAC, no Leonard: -30.5
          -   Jazz single lineup?
              *   Starters: Conley-Clarkson-Markkanen-Vanderbilt-Olynyk
              *   -0.1, 38%tile, 280 possessions
