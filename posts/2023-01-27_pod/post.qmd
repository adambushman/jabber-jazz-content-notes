## Recent Play

*   Past 10 games
    -   Jazz beat Luka-less Mavs at home
    -   Fall to the Blazers in Dame's 60 point game on the road
    -   Beat short-handed Hornets at home
    -   Fall to the Nets w/o KD, beat the Clippers' skeleton crew, beat Wolves, lost to Philly, beat Magic, beat Cavs, lost to Memphis
*   The stats
    -   Record: 6-4
    -   13th in point diff (+2.8)
    -   9th offense, 14th defense
    -   A little lucky on offensive shooting; even on defensive shooting luck
*   Jazz are largely beating the bad teams and losing to the good teams; pretty close to the definition of a 0.500 team
*   Upcoming schedule
    -   TOR, ATL, DAL, MIN all at home; all within 2.5 games of UTA
    -   TRADE DEADLINE
    -   TOR, NYK, IND, MEM all on the road; 2 teams within 2.5 games
    -   ALL-STAR BREAK
*   You're talking 2-4 wins, or 2-6 to 4-4 based on FiveThirtyEight


## Discuss recent trade buzz

*   Marc Stein reports Agbaji has been added to the group of Markkanen and Kessler as "untouchable"
    -   This basically means the Jazz are higher on them than the league
*   Jake Fischer reports Jazz are calling and engaging with teams on trades
    -   Specifically mentions Conley -> LAC as "unrealistic"
*   Shams Charania reports Jazz are still after John Collins
    -   Also mentions kicking the tires on Jalen McDaniels (CHA) and Dorien Finney-Smith
    -   More value plays? More roster construction tests? Punting on wings in the draft?
*   Marc Stein, "there's a half-joking (but also half-serious) policy when it comes to Jazz CEO Danny Ainge that goes something like this: If Ainge is calling about a trade . let it go to voicemail."
    -   Rival execs will do whatever they believe furthers their agenda
    -   But this perspective means they aren't going to engage if they aren't already on board
*   If you had to bet if a deal gets done, the smart money is on no; too much has to go right for everyone to be on board
    -   With that said, I think Jazz swing a trade; wrote an article about it
        *   First opportunity to craft "their" team
        *   Seller's market
        *   Markkanen & Kessler's emergence

## The intriguing group of draft prospects I'm watching

*   5 player group I want 2 of:
    -   Cam Whitmore, GG Jackson, Cason Wallace, Anthony Black, Jarace Walker
*   Where are these guys going?
    -   [Bleacher Report](https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10061849-2023-nba-mock-draft-updated-full-2-round-projections) Big Board: 6 through 17
    -   [The Athletic](https://theathletic.com/4066178/2023/01/12/nba-mock-draft-2023-wembanyama-henderson-whitmore-miller/) Big Board: 4 through 15
    -   [The Ringer](https://nbadraft.theringer.com/) Big Board: 5 through 17
    -   [Sports Illustrated](https://www.si.com/nba/2023/01/12/nba-mock-draft-victor-wembanyama-scoot-henderson-anthony-black) Mock Draft: 3 through 11
    -   [Locked On NBA](https://www.nbabigboard.com/p/nba-mock-draft-new-top-10-picks) Big Board: 8 through 12
*   Why?
    -   Any of these I think you can land on this team regardless of deadline moves
    -   I like Brice Sensabaugh, Gradey Dick, Jett Howard, Maxwell Lewis; I just think they don't land as naturally on this team if everyone remains
*   What has to happen?
    -   Pretty universally, we need one of the MIN-UTA picks to be top 10 and the other to be borderline lottery
    -   Not too difficult
        *   Jazz 1 game out of top 10, 2 games out of top 6
        *   Wolves 1.5 games out of top 10, 2.5 games out of top 6
    -   538 projects
        *   Jazz 3 games out of top 10, 4 games out of top 6
        *   Wolves 2 games out of top 10, 3 games out of top 6
*   Jazz can control their destiny
    -   You move 2 of Conley, Clarkson, Beasley, Olynyk you're likely doing enough to bridge the gap to that #6 area
    -   Even if MIN stays on the border of the lottery, one of those above could find their way there
