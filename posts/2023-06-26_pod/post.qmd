## Approach

*   Measureables (height, weight, etc.)
*   Positions (offense, defense)
*   Impression of how they carry themselves
*   Physical traits
*   Offense, defense traits
*   Comparisons to NBA forerunners 
*   Disclaimer on order and tiers
    -   No confidence short term (first half of rookie deal) any player is better/worse than another
    -   Tiers demonstrate confidence in long term (4-6 years) that the avg player in T1 > T2
    -   Order within the tier is based on personal preference
