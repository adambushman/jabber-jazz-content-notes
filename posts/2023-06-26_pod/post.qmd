## Breakdown of how the draft unfolded

#### Before #9

*   Top 4 was chalk
*   DET going Ausar at 5
    -   Indicated a UTA tradeup was still possible
*   ORL going Black at 6 and IND going Bilalat 7 gave an amazing impression
    -   The WAS-IND switcheroo hurt UTA for Jarace
*   Whitmore falling was heaven sent but Jazz opted for Hendricks

#### Between #10 and #15

*   DAL executed a trade back with OKC
    -   OKC taking Wallace left Whitmore the only remaining tier 3 guy
*   All chalk until TOR with Gradey
*   ATL getting Bufkin was intriguing
*   Whitmore falling again felt like a blessing, Jazz opted for George
    -   Big indication something was seriously wrong with Whitmore

#### Between #16 and #27

*   Lots of variability
    -   Jaquez Jr. went early to MIA
    -   Podziemski early to GSW
    -   Smith Jr. to CHA
    -   Lewis, Miller, Jackson, Jones, Jackson Jr., Sensabaugh all on the board
*   Disappointment
    -   Whitmore went to HOU
    -   Whitehead went to BKN
*   Jazz went with Sensabaugh to the delight of Josh

#### After #28

*   Wild results
    -   GG Jackson falls to #45, MEM
        *   Hate the fit, destination
        *   Amazing value
    -   Colby Jones to #34, SAC
    -   Leonard Miller to #33, MIN
    -   Andre Jackson Jr. to #36, ORL
    -   Maxwell Lewis to #40, LAL
*   All feels like amazing, incredible value
    -   Not everyone will hit but the value proposition is incredible

    *   Kelly likely gets pushed out long term but short term works great
    *   Doubles down on athleticism, length
-   Future
    *   Things go right?
        -   Jaren Jackson Jr. (star)
    *   NBA version of himself right now?
        -   Brook Lopez (contributing starter)
    *   Things go wrong?
        -   Chris Boucher (bench player)

#### Keyonte George

    *   Will be one of the few players we have that can get any shot they want and have a chance to do it well
    *   Enough balance in offense and defense to get you excited
    *   UTA wants to turn him into a PG which is a clear need for the team
-   Future
    *   Things go right?
        -   Bradley Beal or Devin Booker (superstar)

-   Fit
    *   Sensabaugh can score anywhere and in lots of ways
        -   Makes him pretty scalable offensively as his career unfolds
        -   We got a lot of guys who have his tendencies; can be good if done well, can be hurtful if done poorly
    *   Defense is currently pretty suspect; limits portability across lineups
-   Future
    *   Things go right?
        -   Late career DeMar DeRozan or Eric Gordon (valued starter)
    *   NBA version of himself right now?
        -   Cam Thomas (bench player)
    *   Things go wrong?
        -   Jared Butler (out of the league)


## Grading the draft

*   What did we need (IMO)
    -   Shot at a #1 guy, 40% of need
    -   Self-creation, 30%
    -   Passing, 15% of need
    -   Perimeter defense, 15% of need
*   Hendricks at #9: "B"
    -   The safe pick; shoots and plays defense
    -   No creation, limited passing, conservative ceiling
*   George at #16; "A-"
    -   With Hendricks as #9, this is the right upside play
        *   May have preferred Dariq but it's marginal
    -   Has incredible balance in all these areas
    -   Not without risk: turnover prone, streaky, defensive gambler
*   Brice Sensabaugh at #28; "B+"
    -   Incredible value play; often mocked in the top 20
    -   Put together an awesome intersection of efficiency and difficulty
    -   Body work to do, defensive improvement, injury risk
*   Overall grade
    -   B+
    -   Addressed a lot of needs and have guys with clear paths to starter level production
    -   Don't have a feel great prospect to turn into a star


## Looking ahead

*   Rookie seasons
    -   [Riley Gisseman's analysis](https://twitter.com/rgiss11/status/1672291769403473923?s=20) of previous 9, 16, 28 picks
        *   Best player is -0.3 DARKO, or serviceable role player w/ a bright future
        *   Next best is -1.8 DARKO, borderline rotation
        *   Worst is -3.8 DARKO, G-League
    -   Minutes probably reflect a similar story
        *   Taylor probably gets Ochai level minutes: ~1200
            -   Doesn't see the G-League much if, at all, or starts until post-trade deadline, if at all
        *   Keyonte probably gets ~1000 minutes
            -   Spends time in the G-League but when with the team sees a steady, non-starting role
        *   Sensabaugh probably gets Ochai's minutes before starting: ~700
            -   Split half/half with G-League but when with Jazz they give him low-level backup minutes
*   Beyond
    -   [Riley Gisseman's analysis](https://twitter.com/rgiss11/status/1672292444367654914?s=20) of previous 9, 16, 28 picks at end of their rookie deal
        *   Best player is +2.0 DARKO, or a high level starter
        *   Next best is 0.0 DARKO, or 5th starter/6th man
        *   Worst is out of the league
    -   Spot checking history with 3 pick teams bears it out too
        *   ATL in 2018 had 3 picks
            -   Young #5, Huerter #19, Spellman #30
            -   Exactly as outlined
        *   LAL in 2015 had 3 picks
            -   Russell #2, Nance Jr. #27, Brown #34
    -   Jazz are still missing the star, the #1 option
        *   Given the pick situation, always more likely to happen via trade than the draft
        *   Lauri could take another leap (would bet against it, though)
        *   Keyonte is the best hope currently of the youngins (not confident)
    -   Jazz are also still missing a wing defender you want on the opposing guys
        *   Lauri, Ochai, Taylor are the best bets; don't feel great about any of them
