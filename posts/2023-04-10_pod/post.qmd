## 2023 NBA draft look ahead \#4

Starter Questions:

*   What matters/doesn't matter to you different from consensus in prospect evaluation?
*   We throw around the term "wing" a lot; what have you understood it to mean?
*   What are the Jazz most in need of? Can that reasonably come from the draft?

  age = round(as.numeric((lubridate::as_date(Sys.Date()) - lubridate::as_date(birthdate)) / 365.25), 1)
  
  if(stringr::str_length(as.character(age)) == 2) {
    age = paste(age, ".0", sep = "")
  }
  return(as.character(age))

```

### Tier 1

Questions:

*   Unique to have Scoot in the same tier as Victor; why?


```{r}
#| echo: false

render_tier(tiers, c("Tier: 1"))

```

### Tier 2

Questions:

*   How do you define this tier? Ceiling, floor, avg outcome?
*   What is it about Cam that has you over the moon?


```{r}
#| echo: false

render_tier(tiers, c("Tier: 2"))

```



### Tier 3

Questions:

*   What do you say to those who dismiss the ceiling for Cason Wallace?
*   Dariq Whitehead is a big riser here despite showing so little at Duke; why?
*   Hendricks is flying up boards and often in the top 10; why just #12?

```{r}
#| echo: false

render_tier(tiers, c("Tier: 3"))

```


### Tier 4

Questions:

*   Where do you think George and Smith Jr. get drafted? Mocked a little low relative to consensus
*   How did you differentiate Jett Howard, Gradey Dick and Jordan Hawkins?
*   What do you make of Sensabaugh or Hood-Schifino on the Jazz?

```{r}
#| echo: false

render_tier(tiers, c("Tier: 4"))

```

### Tier 5

Questions:

*   What's so intriguing about Bilal Coulibaly for those unfamiliar?
*   Who else in this group excites you the most in their fit with the Jazz?

```{r}
#| echo: false

render_tier(tiers, c("Tier: 5"))

```
