Today:

*   Run through final big board
    -   Chat risers/fallers
    -   Orient to industry expectation
*   Execute final draft simulation

Let's Jabber Jazz!


## Approach

*   Measureables (height, weight, etc.)
*   Positions (offense, defense)
*   Impression of how they carry themselves
*   Physical traits
*   Offense, defense traits
*   Comparisons to NBA forerunners 
*   Disclaimer on order and tiers
    -   No confidence short term (first half of rookie deal) any player is better/worse than another
    -   Tiers demonstrate confidence in long term (4-6 years) that the avg player in T1 > T2
    -   Order within the tier is based on personal preference

### Tier 1

No changes

```{r}
#| echo: false

render_tier(tiers, c("Tier: 1"))

```


### Tier 2

No changes

I like Brandon and Scoot virtually the same. My own personal blend of metrics rates them out as equal prospects. I cede to Miller based on the position nad height.


```{r}
#| echo: false

render_tier(tiers, c("Tier: 2"))

```



### Tier 3

One change is GG Jackson falls out of this tier.

I'm perfectly content with one of these players at 9, though as is demonstrated with the order, Hendricks is probably my least favorite option. Ideally, Jazz can pick from 2-3 of the below.


```{r}
#| echo: false

render_tier(tiers, c("Tier: 3"))

```


### Tier 4

Jalen Hood-Schifino, 4 spots ahead of industry:

*   I buy the defense
*   Midrange capable like he is in the PnR can be a major weapon in the playoffs

Dariq Whitehead, 11 spots ahead of industry: 

*   There's a lot of self-creation masked at Duke
*   Injuries hid a lot of his athleticism

Maxwell Lewis, 9 spots ahead of industry:

*   He's very fluid, deceptively quick first step
*   Has a foundational skill set in everything
*   His recruitment and path through Pepperdine was weird

GG Jackson, 12 spots ahead of industry, 5 spots lower than previous:

*   Rumors of poor interviews, workouts, etc.
    -   Some appears valid, others appear as smoke screens
*   I just buy the package and am willing to take the big swing
*   Would absolutely take him at #16; at #28 I'd be pissed if Utah didn't grab him

Leonard Miller, 4 spots ahead of industry, 8 spots ahead of previous:

*   Watched more of the high school tape; demonstrated a lot of initiation, passing
*   Effort and diversity of his game shown at Ignite was impressive

Bilal Coulibaly, 7 spots behind industry

*   Physical displays are impressive
    -   Official measurements
    -   Crazy fluid and confident
    -   Thinner than anticipated
*   More raw than most admit; closer to Rayan Rupert than like Maxwell Lewis or Leonard Miller skill-wise right now
*   Don't think there's enough due hesitancy over that he's played with a prospective Hall of Famer in Wembanyama and likely won't with his new team

Gradey Dick, 9 spots behind industry

*   The lack of self-creation potential is unfortunate
*   Handle, wiggle are missing
*   Lack of defense is overrated

Dereck Lively II, 10 spots behind industry

*   I think there's a lot of forcing Lively to DAL, NOP
*   Like Lively a ton but the C position isn't ideal to invest in
    -   They hit more often than G/F and are generally less valuable
*   Even in a redraft, given what we know about Kessler, he's only going around 10

Nick Smith Jr., 8 spots behind industry

*   Didn't like how he was always sped up
*   I think his floater style in the midrange and wanting to be ball dominant is a tough way to live in the NBA

### Tier 5

Any variation from industry average is likely captured in the range


```{r}

render_tier(tiers, c("Tier: 5"))

```

### Tier 6

Any variation from the industry is likely captured in the range


```{r}
