## Season Summary

*   How many questions did we have coming in?
    -   Jazz tanking or winning?
    -   What kind of a coach is Hardy?
    -   Who are the short and long term characters?
    -   Where will the picks end up?
*   Approach to grades
    -   Relative scale to expectations
    -   C is passing, as in met expectations
        *   F is completely unmet expectations
        *   A is completely blowing away expectations
    -   Just players who logged more than 100 minutes


## Team Grades

*   Direction
    -   Wish-washed the entire season, compromising better draft position and legitimate playoff experience for a young core
    -   Ended just outside of the dreaded "middle ground"
    -   Grade: D
*   Development
    -   Saw major strides across the entire team
    -   Development minutes were hard to find early; some inexplicable allocation
    -   Grade: A-
*   Moves
    -   Went from limited picks and non-star valuable players to a host of both
    -   Rotated players with little to no long term potential for those with such
    -   Got ~90%+ of all they hoped for in deals
    -   Grade: B+

## Player Grades

*   Lauri Markkanen
    -   Went from roll player, starter to All-Star / All-NBA level
    -   Showed everything but self-creation
    -   Grade: A
*   Jordan Clarkson
    -   Demonstrated improved awareness and instincts for passing
    -   Grade: C+
*   Kelly Olynyk
    -   Had one of his best seasons; basically put it all together at a 5-10% overall
    -   Grade: B-
*   Walker Kessler
    -   Everything we saw in college translated far above what was expected
    -   Haven't yet seen anything new
    -   Grade: A-
*   Malik Beasley
    -   Excellent shooter...below avg elsewhere
    -   Grade: C
*   Talen Horton-Tucker
    -   Showed a lot more as a playmaker for others
    -   Grade: B-
*   Mike Conley
    -   Thought he'd get injured again and was unsure about his interest in the direction
    -   Grade: B
*   Jarred Vanderbilt
    -   Overrated 1-on-1 defender
    -   Doesn't impact winning much
    -   Grade: D+
*   Ochai Agbaji
    -   Thought he'd be more ready
    -   Saw some good stuff at the end of the year
    -   Expected a good, rotational player
    -   Grade: C+
*   Collin Sexton
    -   Better shooter, better habits, etc.

*   Rudy Gay
    -   Literally everything I expected, except that looking at the stats he got worse at everything
    -   Grade: D+
*   Simone Fontecchio
    -   Thought he'd be more consistent
    -   Grade: C-
*   Kris Dunn
    -   Not only is he an NBA, but a rotation PG

*   Damian Jones
    -   Showed he can play with another big and has a two-way game
    -   Grade: B-
*   Johnny Juzang
    -   Showed some stuff but I thought he'd see more time and would shoot better

    -   Only two returning members: Jensen and Skeeter

*   Front Office
    -   Amazing trades over the offseason
    -   Tried to tip-toe two directions, have their cake and eat it too

    -   Some nice pick ups and value rebuild guys like Dunn
    -   Grade: B+
*   Ownership
    -   Pulled the plug on a cooked but really good team
    -   Executed a terrible rebrand
    -   Extended the ATTSN contract for another season, accentuating another terrible regional sports network
    -   Grade: C-
