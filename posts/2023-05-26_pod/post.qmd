## What's the word on the draft

Let's get into a host of things here for a complete understanding of this class

*   Reputation
    -   Victor
    -   Non-collegiate, international guys
        *   4 international
        *   5 domestic leagues
    -   Depth for roll players
    -   Contrasts: age, size, skill (few bigs)
*   Layout
    -   Top: athleticism & size; lack of shooting
    -   Middle: a mix of specialists
    -   End: upside plays
*   Start/end
    -   Big fallers (premier, recruited talents):
        *   Injuries, immaturity, system
    -   Big risers:
        *   Balanced game, high level production
*   Lottery
    -   SAS gets Victor
    -   Q's at 2/3 (CHA/POR)
    -   HOU/POR/DAL open for trading; DET/ORL could be too
*   Jazz picks
    -   9 (own), 16 (via MIN in Gobert trade), 28 (via PHI in the O'Neale trade)


## Who are the names to know

*   Scoot Henderson: mix of Rose and CP3
*   Brandon Miller/Cam Whitmore: prototypical wing all teams want
*   Thompson Twins: ultra athletes, two-way players, lack shooting
*   Hendricks/Walker: combo 4/5 with versatile defense and distinct offensive games
*   Wallace and Black: contrasts of styles

Why know these names?

*   Jazz at 9 will have the option for one of these; generally thought of as the top tier
*   Jazz have ammo to trade with *some* of these


## Who are the names to watch for

*   Sharp shooters
    -   Gradey Dick
    -   Keyonte George
    -   Jordan Hawkins
    -   Jett Howard
    -   Dariq Whitehead
*   Upside wings/forwards
    -   Leonard Miller
    -   Sidy Cissoko
    -   Maxwell Lewis
    -   Bilal Coulibaly
    -   GG Jackson
    

## What's coming through the grapevine on Utah

*   Jazz want positional size (tall and long for your position)
    -   6'6" PG, 6'9" Wings, etc.
*   Jazz are avoiding players at the 5
*   Jazz have worked out and interviewed many of the players aforementioned
*   Jazz are confident they have good options at current spots
