## What's the 2023 NBA draft looking like for the Utah Jazz?

2023 draft is unique:

*   Generational talent
*   Deep star player pool
*   Wide group of potential contributors

Speaking for myself, I always get started on draft stuff far too late. 

Josh, however, is keeping a steady pulse so we're going to digest his 1st round big board.

```{r}
#| echo: false

to_age <- function(birthdate) {
  age = round(as.numeric((lubridate::as_date(Sys.Date()) - lubridate::as_date(birthdate)) / 365.25), 1)
  
  if(stringr::str_length(as.character(age)) == 2) {
    age = paste(age, ".0", sep = "")
  }
  return(as.character(age))
}

leif_tiers <- 
  readxl::read_xlsx(
    'C:/Users/Adam Bushman/Documents/R/jabber-jazz-content-notes/master_files/2023_draft_big_boards.xlsx', 
    sheet = 'Josh-Roberts'
  ) |>
  dplyr::mutate(
    age = unlist(purrr::map(birthdate, to_age))
  ) |> 
  dplyr::select(-birthdate)

```

### Tier 1

Single prospect: Victor Wembanyama

Generational talent, best player in the league potential

Questions:

*   Explain why Victor fits this potential for you?

```{r}
#| echo: false

josh_tiers |>
  dplyr::filter(stringr::str_sub(tier, 1, 7) == "Tier #1") |>
  gt::gt(
    rowname_col = "pick", 
    groupname_col = "tier"
  ) |>
  gt::cols_merge(
    columns = c(off_position, def_position), 
    pattern = "{1}<br>{2}"
  ) |>
  gt::cols_merge(
    columns = c(height, weight, age), 
    pattern = "{1}<br>{2}<br>{3}"
  ) |>
  gt::tab_header(
    title = "Josh's Big Board", 
    subtitle = "2023 NBA Draft | As of Dec 1st, 2022"
  ) |>
  gt::cols_label(
    name = "Prospect Name", 
    off_position = "Position", 
    height = "Measures", 
    club = "Club Name"
  ) |>
  gt::tab_source_note(source_note = "Josh Roberts | Twitter: @jayjazz3") |>
  gt::tab_style(
    style = gt::cell_text(size = gt::px(11)), 
    locations = gt::cells_body(columns = c(height, off_position))
  ) |>
  gt::tab_options(
    heading.background.color = "#050505", 
    
    column_labels.font.weight = "bold", 
    
    row_group.background.color = "#f6ee26", 
    row_group.padding = gt::px(0), 
    
    source_notes.background.color = "#dbe2ea"
  ) 

```


### Tier 2

Questions:

*   Instead of positions/needs, what styles are you looking for?
*   Opportunity with Ausar? Usually 3-5 pick gap?
*   Are you up on anyone moving up a tier?
*   Are you down on anyone to where they could slip a tier?
*   Anyone else you want to mention?
*   Potential for Jazz to have 1 pick here
    -   Assume pick 6-8: who are you going with?

```{r}
#| echo: false

josh_tiers |>
  dplyr::filter(stringr::str_sub(tier, 1, 7) == "Tier #2") |>
  gt::gt(
    rowname_col = "pick", 
    groupname_col = "tier"
  ) |>
    gt::cols_merge(
    columns = c(off_position, def_position), 
    pattern = "{1}<br>{2}"
  ) |>
    gt::cols_merge(
    columns = c(height, weight, age), 
    pattern = "{1}<br>{2}<br>{3}"
  ) |>
  gt::tab_header(
    title = "Josh's Big Board", 
    subtitle = "2023 NBA Draft | As of Dec 1st, 2022"
  ) |>
  gt::cols_label(
    name = "Prospect Name", 
    off_position = "Position", 
    height = "Measures", 
    club = "Club Name"
  ) |>
  gt::tab_source_note(source_note = "Josh Roberts | Twitter: @jayjazz3") |>
  gt::tab_style(
    style = gt::cell_text(size = gt::px(11)), 
    locations = gt::cells_body(columns = c(height, off_position))
  ) |>
  gt::tab_options(
    heading.background.color = "#050505", 
    
    column_labels.font.weight = "bold", 
    
    row_group.background.color = "#f6ee26", 
    row_group.padding = gt::px(0), 
    
    source_notes.background.color = "#dbe2ea"
  ) 

```


### Tier 3

Questions:

*   You're high on GG Jackson and he's impressing; realistically does he stay out of the top 10?
*   What has you concerned on Keyonte George?
*   Handful of bigs: Kilipowski, Ware, Lively: higher on any more than Kessler?
*   Are you up on anyone moving up a tier?
*   Are you down on anyone to where they could slip a tier?
*   Anyone else you want to mention?
*   Potential for Jazz to have 2 picks here
    -   Who are you going with?

```{r}
#| echo: false

josh_tiers |>
  dplyr::filter(stringr::str_sub(tier, 1, 7) == "Tier #3") |>
  gt::gt(
    rowname_col = "pick", 
    groupname_col = "tier"
  ) |>
    gt::cols_merge(
    columns = c(off_position, def_position), 
    pattern = "{1}<br>{2}"
  ) |>
    gt::cols_merge(
    columns = c(height, weight, age), 
    pattern = "{1}<br>{2}<br>{3}"
  ) |>
  gt::tab_header(
    title = "Josh's Big Board", 
    subtitle = "2023 NBA Draft | As of Dec 1st, 2022"
  ) |>
  gt::cols_label(
    name = "Prospect Name", 
    off_position = "Position", 
    height = "Measures", 
    club = "Club Name"
  ) |>
  gt::tab_source_note(source_note = "Josh Roberts | Twitter: @jayjazz3") |>
  gt::tab_style(
    style = gt::cell_text(size = gt::px(11)), 
    locations = gt::cells_body(columns = c(height, off_position))
  ) |>
  gt::tab_options(
    heading.background.color = "#050505", 
    
    column_labels.font.weight = "bold", 
    
    row_group.background.color = "#f6ee26", 
    row_group.padding = gt::px(0), 
    
    source_notes.background.color = "#dbe2ea"
  ) 

```


### Tier 4

Questions:

*   Is there reason to jump tiers?
    -   Say give up your #19 and #26 picks and Gay's expiring for a bigger, long salary and #14 to get Gradey Dick
    -   Worth it?
*   Lots of small guards here: Sasser, Hunter, McCollum
    -   Any reservations with size?
*   Only 30; is tier #4 larger if you include 2nd round?
*   Are you up on anyone moving up a tier?
*   Are you down on anyone to where they could slip a tier?
*   Anyone else you want to mention?
*   Potential for Jazz to have 1 pick here
    -   Assume pick 17-19: who are you going with?
    -   Assume pick 25-30: who are you going with?

```{r}
#| echo: false

josh_tiers |>
  dplyr::filter(stringr::str_sub(tier, 1, 7) == "Tier #4") |>
  gt::gt(
    rowname_col = "pick", 
    groupname_col = "tier"
  ) |>
    gt::cols_merge(
    columns = c(off_position, def_position), 
    pattern = "{1}<br>{2}"
  ) |>
    gt::cols_merge(
    columns = c(height, weight, age), 
    pattern = "{1}<br>{2}<br>{3}"
  ) |>
  gt::tab_header(
    title = "Josh's Big Board", 
    subtitle = "2023 NBA Draft | As of Dec 1st, 2022"
  ) |>
  gt::cols_label(
    name = "Prospect Name", 
    off_position = "Position", 
    height = "Measures", 
    club = "Club Name"
  ) |>
  gt::tab_source_note(source_note = "Josh Roberts | Twitter: @jayjazz3") |>
  gt::tab_style(
    style = gt::cell_text(size = gt::px(11)), 
    locations = gt::cells_body(columns = c(height, off_position))
  ) |>
  gt::tab_options(
    heading.background.color = "#050505", 
    
    column_labels.font.weight = "bold", 
    
    row_group.background.color = "#f6ee26", 
    row_group.padding = gt::px(0), 
    
    source_notes.background.color = "#dbe2ea"
  ) 

```
