## Draft Targets at 9

#### Jarace Walker

*   Like
    -   Passing
    -   Defense
    -   Enough creation potential for me
*   Fit 
    -   Love the front court trio of Lauri, Jarace, Walker
    -   Elite defense immediately
    -   Run some PnR, operate at the nail, spot up in the corner
*   Range
    -   Industry boards mock him between 4 and 8

#### Cam Whitmore

*   Like
    -   Athleticism
    -   Creation
    -   The potential
*   Fit
    -   Could operate at the 2 or 3, complimenting Lauri well
    -   Jazz need creation
*   Range
    -   Industry boards mock him between 4 and 7

#### Ausar Thompson

*   Like
    -   Feel and instincts for the game
    -   Balanced skills and complimentary style
    -   Not a concern on the shot
*   Fit
    -   The athleticism and speed compliments our finishers
    -   The passing and defense are sore needs
    -   Maybe he develops into a lead G which would be monumental
*   Range
    -   Industry boards mock him between 6 and 8

#### Anthony Black

*   Like
    -   The defense
    -   Floor raiser with his connective style on offense
*   Fit
    -   Passing and defense is what we need; position size is great
    -   PnR with Kessler; hitting Markkanen on cuts
*   Range
    -   Industry boards mock him between 6 and 10

#### Taylor Hendricks

*   Like
    -   The shot and rim protection combo is awesome
    -   Enough athleticism to round out a nice frontcourt trio
*   Fit
    -   Compliments Markkanen and Kessler except for self-creation
*   Range
    -   Industry boards mock him between 6 and 14
    
    
How often can you get one of these at 9?

*   In 500 out 500 simulations (100%)


## Draft Targets at 16

#### Cason Wallace

*   Like
    -   Floor raising
    -   Seems like the perfect guard to do all the complimentary stuff and give you a star game when needed
*   Fit
    -   The lack of creation is troublesome but he's an elite complimentary piece
    -   Scales with everyone on the roster and most anyone you'd like to bring in
*   Range
    -   Industry boards mock him between 8 and 17

#### Jalen Hood-Schifino

*   Like
    -   The passing and defense
    -   Ability to punish drop coverage
    -   Excellent size at 6'4" w/o shoes and 6'10" wingspan
*   Fit
    -   Again, looks to be a great complimentary piece to a strong core
    -   Jazz have some midrange operators but none with as strong of passing
*   Range
    -   Industry boards mock him between 9 and 21

#### Kobe Bufkin

*   Like
    -   Met both the eye and data test
    -   Such a strong foundation in every skill
*   Fit
    -   Another combo guard without true lead guard pedigree but scales with everyone on the roster
*   Range
    -   Industry boards mock him between 12 and 22

#### Keyonte George

*   Like
    -   Great pedigree
    -   Demonstrated elite abilities creating with the ball
*   Fit
    -   Elite shot makers with size always have a spot in a lineup
*   Range
    -   Industry boards mock him between 10 and 22

#### Bilal Coulibaly

*   Like
    -   So fluid, graceful, and coordinated
    -   Excellent size and youth
*   Fit
    -   Could be a draft steal given how many boxes he checks; not without risk, though
*   Range
    -   Industry boards mock him between 11 and 33
    
    
How often can you get one of these at 16?

#### Dariq Whitehead

*   Like
    -   Really elite shooter
    -   Awesome high school pedigree for self-creation and athleticism

    -   A great floor and ceiling combo at a great position
*   Range
    -   Industry boards mock him between 16 and 35

#### GG Jackson

*   Like
    -   Elite self-creator
    -   Some of the best combo of youth, measureables, and athleticism
*   Fit
    -   The ideal 3 to surround our guys, giving the biggest need: creation
*   Range

#### Maxwell Lewis

*   Like
    -   Size and ease of movement
    -   Nice looking shot and some creation potential

    -   Brings some creation we need; potential with some defense

#### Colby Jones

*   Like
    -   Great floor raiser; does a bit of everything well
    -   Passing, defense, shooting; very portable
*   Fit
    -   I think he could turn into a PG; handled the ball a lot in the halfcourt for Xavier
    -   Meshes nicely with any G; kinda the model BOS went after
*   Range
    -   Industry boards mock him between 19 and 48

#### Andre Jackson

*   Like
    -   Excellent defense and passing
    -   Brings a winning mindset and impact
