## Second 2023 NBA draft Look Ahead

Starter Questions:

*   How do you describe your evaluation?
*   What are the player archtypes or skills that "break ties" for you?
*   What's the next fad you anticipate that defines player comps and skill set preferences?

# Guest variables
name = "Leif"
as_of_date = "January 12th, 2023"

# Transforming birthday to age
to_age <- function(birthdate) {
  age = round(as.numeric((lubridate::as_date(Sys.Date()) - lubridate::as_date(birthdate)) / 365.25), 1)
  
  if(stringr::str_length(as.character(age)) == 2) {
    age = paste(age, ".0", sep = "")
  }
  return(as.character(age))
}

# Transforming birthday to age
tiers <- 
  readxl::read_xlsx(
    here("master_files/2023_draft_big_boards.xlsx"), 
    sheet = 'Leif-Thulin'
  ) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(
    age = paste(unlist(purrr::map(birthdate, to_age)), "yrs")
  ) %>% 
  dplyr::select(-birthdate)

  board %>%
    filter(tier %in% selected_tiers) %>%

      groupname_col = "tier"
    ) %>%

}

### First 10

Questions:

*   How do you tier the first few prospects? Wemby and everyone? Scoot on an island?
*   Brandon Miller: what are the debates here?
    -   YES: he's done this for long enough
    -   YES: he was highly thought of
    -   YES: others around him have flaws too
*   GG Jackson: rising across big boards? Why and how far?
*   Anthony Black is an electric play maker; what's the weakness and NBA comp?


```{r}
#| echo: false

render_tier(tiers, c("First 10"))

```


### Middle 10

Questions:

*   Nick Smith Jr. out of the top 10 is pretty unique; what's the deal?
*   Jarace Walker...where is he defensively and athletically? Cam lite?
*   Jazz likely to have a pick in 9 - 13 range; who are you shooting for?
*   Baba Miller doesn't seem to be getting a lot of attention
    -   Draymond Green offense, Tayshaun Prince defense
*   Jett Howard vs Gradey Dick as a shooter?

```{r}
#| echo: false

render_tier(tiers, c("Middle 10"))

```


### Last 10

Questions:

*   Kyle Filipowski: pretty low on him, what's the gap? Is he just Frank Kaminsky 2.0?
*   Rayan Rupert -> what makes him an intriguing player?
*   Brice Sensabaugh is another guy not gettin much fanfare
*   Jazz should have a pick in the bottom 5; who sticks out??

```{r}
#| echo: false

render_tier(tiers, c("Last 10"))

```


### This Season

Thoughts on this season?

*   The young guys
*   Who's part of the future
*   How does the team lean going forward?
