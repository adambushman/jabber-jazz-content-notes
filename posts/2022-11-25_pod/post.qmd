## Did the Jazz choose the right direction this offseason?

The success to start this season is prompting a lot of questions.

Our question is if the Jazz went the right direction with "the blowup"?

Assumptions:

*   Jazz are executing a transition but are all in on winning
*   Jazz still hire Will Hardy: Quin was going to leave no matter what
*   Jazz still trade O'Neale: flexibility move Jazz needed no matter what
*   House, Hernangomez, etc., aren't shoe-in returning players
*   We preserve "full hindsight" in our analysis

### Scenario 1: Stay the course

![Scenario 1](scenario-1-02.jpg)

9 Man Rotation: 

*   Starters: Conley, Mitchell, ?, Bogdanovic, Gobert
*   Next 4: Clarkson, ?, Gay, ?

Other Figures:

*   Unprotected 1sts: 6 (assuming OKC conveys)
*   Protected 1sts: 1
*   Median Age: 29
*   '23-'24 Guaranteed Roster Count: 8
*   '23-'24 Guaranteed Salary vs Cap: 91%

Questions:

*   How does this team play offensively?
    -   Spread PnR, some isolation
*   How does this team play defensively?
    -   I think they get out of the shell a bit more
    -   Probably force some more turnovers
    -   Gobert on the perimeter more and accountability on the backline
*   How fun is this group?
    -   They'd win a lot but just transplanting Hardy doesn't solve root cause Gobert/Mitchell
*   What's the immediate ceiling?
    -   Still "contender" but no one trusts them, potentially even themselves
*   What's the contender window for this squad?
    -   Probably had two years, until Conley's contract ends
*   How optimistic are you for the future?
    -   Not very; real improvement would've cost those far out picks 

### Scenario 2: Rudy trade

![Scenario 2](scenario-2-02.jpg)

9 Man Rotation: 

*   Starters: Conley, Mitchell, Bogdanovic, Vanderbilt, ?
*   Next 4: Clarkson, Beasley, Gay, Kessler

Other Figures:

*   Unprotected 1sts: 9 (assuming OKC conveys)
*   Protected 1sts: 2
*   Median Age: 27
*   '23-'24 Guaranteed Roster Count: 7
*   '23-'24 Guaranteed Salary vs Cap: 59%

Questions:

*   How does this team play offensively?
    -   Depends on the C; they go after Kelly, we see a lot of PnR and PnP
    -   Pretty prolific offensively
    -   Don't anticipate a rolling big with Vando
*   How does this team play defensively?
    -   They probably are trying to lean into that caos but they're average best case scenario
*   How fun is this group?
    -   Pretty prolific offensively
    -   Definitely would've been good and deep, with assets to improve
*   What's the immediate ceiling?
    -   Competitive in 1st round, likely not exiting the 2nd
*   What's the contender window for this squad?
    -   Depends on Mitchell-Hardy; no Gobert means Don is happier
    -   Still is probably only 2 years
*   How optimistic are you for the future?
    -   Jazz have a ton of guard depth and shooting; ideally you snag a John Collins type with the extra assets
    -   Reasonably optimistic that we're getting younger and more flexible

### Scenario 3: Donovan trade

![Scenario 3](scenario-3-02.jpg)

9 Man Rotation: 

*   Starters: Conley, Clarkson, Bogdanovic, Markkanen, Gobert
*   Next 4: Sexton, ?, Gay, ?

Other Figures:

*   Unprotected 1sts: 9 (assuming OKC conveys)
*   Protected 1sts: 1
*   Median Age: 29
*   '23-'24 Guaranteed Roster Count: 8
*   '23-'24 Guaranteed Salary vs Cap: 87%

Questions:

*   How does this team play offensively?
    -   A ton of spread PnR with good shooters
    -   I don't think Lauri is quite as unlocked via cuts with Gobert in the middle
    -   Still very efficient and potent
*   How does this team play defensively?
    -   Secondary rim protection was always missing since Favors
    -   Not quick at all on the perimeter
*   How fun is this group?
    -   I think this group is really fun; no Don-Rudy hanging over everything
    -   Rudy would've stayed as long as we wanted
*   What's the immediate ceiling?
    -   Because *this* version of Lauri isn't a #1, volume scorer, you're looking at competitive first round only
*   What's the contender window for this squad?
    -   You realistically have 2-3 years, rest of Gobert's prime and contract
*   How optimistic are you for the future?
    -   Not all that confident; Jazz are still *too* old
    -   Jazz would've been forced to execute another star trade (Butler?) immediately
        *   Depth compromised

### Scenario 4: Full blowup

![Scenario 4](scenario-4-02.jpg)

9 Man Rotation: 

*   Starters: Conley, Clarkson, Markkanen, Vanderbilt, Olynyk
*   Next 4: Sexton, Beasley, Gay, Kessler

Other Figures:

*   Unprotected 1sts: 12 (assuming OKC conveys)
*   Protected 1sts: 2
*   Median Age: 26
*   '23-'24 Guaranteed Roster Count: 7
*   '23-'24 Guaranteed Salary vs Cap: 58%

Questions:

*   What's the immediate ceiling?
    -   Competitive in the first round
*   What's the contender window for this squad?
    -   Because of Lauri(25) and Kessler(21), there's nearly a decade if the Jazz play it right
*   How optimistic are you for the future?
    -   Pretty optimistic though true contention requires a #1, a top 10-15 player
        *   We don't have one


### Conclusion

![Scenario Comp](scenario-comparison.jpg)

Which direction did you want at the time? Why?

*   I wanted #1 or #2
    -   It either works with two top 20 players excelling on either side of the ball or not

Which direction would you choose now with perfect hindsight? Why?

*   Either #2 or #4
    -   Hardy has been that impressive with his relationships; could've done wonders for Donovan
    -   Still concern over Don bolting
