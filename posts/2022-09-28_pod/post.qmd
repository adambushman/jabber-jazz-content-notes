## We're back

4 years ago started a blog, podcast, YouTube channel to deliver more fan content.

Pandemic hit, shut down the NBA, made the decision to go back to school. 

Opted to suspend Jabber Jazz content to focus.

Earned my bachelor's in data science and statistics. 

Joined the team at [SLC Dunk](www.slcdunk.com).

I decided to resurrect Jabber Jazz.

New look, similar content. Shout out to Lucas Deal for the music!

Expectations:

*   Regular pods
    -   Short episodes on what's taking place
    -   Long interviews on macro topics affecting the team
*   Video series
    -   Podcast highlights
    -   "NBA Stats Explained" series
