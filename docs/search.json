We’re still gonna try and compete’. Almost nothing that the Jazz have said publicly for 4 or 5 months has actually been true. ‘We’re going to build around Donovan’, ‘We don’t need to trade Bogdanovic before camp’, ‘We’ve got good veterans, we’re going to try and win these games’. Don’t judge their words, judge their actions.”\n\nVets will play - Buy\n\nJazz traded one vet (Bogey) for another vet (Olynyk) to better compliment the roster\nBalance and the right ecosystem for development is what’s being considered\n\nBad examples: PHI, SAC\n\n\nMalik is shooting the heck out of the ball - Buy\n\n38% shooter last 1,000 attempts\n38% - 41% Catch and Shoot\n36% - 38% Pullup\n\nSexton playing both ends (O and D) every night - Sexton, Hardy comments - Sell\n\nJazz aren’t going to sub him out for every defensive possession so “technically” he’ll play\nSelling on him being a contributor/average defensively\n\nEnergy and vibe around team - Tony Jones, Sexton, Clarkson - Buy!\n\nHardy and Sexton big drivers\nClarkson and Conley accentuating new culture\nWe’re seeing it in every video/photo\nSarah Todd’s article: worst vibes last year\n\nKessler “leaps and bounds ahead” - Conley via Todd’s article - Buy\n\nVery cerebral\nSuper impressed by his logic and preparation"
