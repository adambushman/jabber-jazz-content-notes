We’re still gonna try and compete’. Almost nothing that the Jazz have said publicly for 4 or 5 months has actually been true. ‘We’re going to build around Donovan’, ‘We don’t need to trade Bogdanovic before camp’, ‘We’ve got good veterans, we’re going to try and win these games’. Don’t judge their words, judge their actions.”\n\nVets will play - Buy\n\nJazz traded one vet (Bogey) for another vet (Olynyk) to better compliment the roster\nBalance and the right ecosystem for development is what’s being considered\n\nBad examples: PHI, SAC\n\n\nMalik is shooting the heck out of the ball - Buy\n\n38% shooter last 1,000 attempts\n38% - 41% Catch and Shoot\n36% - 38% Pullup\n\nSexton playing both ends (O and D) every night - Sexton, Hardy comments - Sell\n\nJazz aren’t going to sub him out for every defensive possession so “technically” he’ll play\nSelling on him being a contributor/average defensively\n\nEnergy and vibe around team - Tony Jones, Sexton, Clarkson - Buy!\n\nHardy and Sexton big drivers\nClarkson and Conley accentuating new culture\nWe’re seeing it in every video/photo\nSarah Todd’s article: worst vibes last year\n\nKessler “leaps and bounds ahead” - Conley via Todd’s article - Buy\n\nVery cerebral\nSuper impressed by his logic and preparation"

They are stylistic comparisons.\nWe’ll stay away from drawing exact conclusions and instead just consider them as potential future paths the franchise may traverse.\n\n2011-12 Denver Nuggets\nTimeline:\n\nTraded Carmelo Anthony -> NYK in the offseason\n\n2 firsts, 2 seconds, 1 swap\nChandler, Mozgov, Felton, Gallinari, Koufos\nCash\n\nWith a scrappy squad of no #1s, finished 6th and then 3rd in West\nSubsequent finishes\n\n11th in West\n12th in West\n\nNever completely bottomed out\n\nGot lucky(?) with NYK being bad and turning into Jamal Murray\nGot lucky with Jokic in the 2nd round\n\n\nTakeaways:\n\nIt’s a cautionary tale of delaying the inevitable\nIt’s also a case of building and losing value because you bought into it\n\n\n\nPost-Kawhi Spurs\nTimeline:\n\nKawhi Leonard -> SAS in the offseason\n\nDemar DeRozan, Jakob Poeltl, 1st\n\nNever tanked, until possibly this very season, yet…\n\n2018\n\n#18 - Lonnie Walker\n\n2019\n\n#19 - Luka Samanic\n#29 - Keldon Johnson\n\n2020\n\n#11 - Devin Vassell\n\n2021\n\n#12 - Josh Primo\n\n2022\n\n#9 - Jeremy Sochan\n#20 - Malachi Branham\n#25 - Blake Wesley\n\n\n8 first round picks in 5 seasons\n\nLucky with Johnson\nUnlucky with Primo\nPotential with Vassell, Sochan\nRest are meh\n\n\nTakeaways:\n\nJazz have 11 (minus 1) firsts in the next 5 seasons\nGoal of high picks is to avoid being dependent on other teams missing on prospects\nSpurs had a foundation but mid-picks never pushed them anywhere\n\nSimilarly, Jazz have a foundation but lack that star\n\n\n\n\n2013-14 Phoenix Suns\n\nWent 48-34 after a single bad year post-Steve Nash\nNew coach in Jeff Hornacek\nGood mix of youth and veterans\n\nBoth Morris twins\n5th year Goran Dragic\n2nd year PJ Tucker\n3rd year Eric Bledsoe\n\nWent on to have 6 straight losing seasons\n\nLot of good players came and went:\n\nSeth Curry\nTJ Warren\nReggie Bullock\nDerrick Jones Jr.\n\nSwings and misses\n\nMarquisse Chriss\nDragan Bender\nJosh Jackson\n\n\n\nTakeaways:\n\nPHX executed a transition and found some success but they lacked the super star\nEven after drafting him (Booker) they lacked the development around him\nThey had bad luck (can happen, for sure)\nThey’ve still achieved more post-Steve Nash than Utah has post-Stockton/Malone in less time\n\nAlways fun; heck no\nQuantity vs quality game"

    "text": "Trade Talk Is Afoot\nThese ideas came from the Lowe Post podcast. Zach Lowe and Bobby Marks of ESPN discussed these frameworks.\nWe’ll comment from a Jazz fan and team perspective.\n\nTrade #1\n\nUTA & BKN (made O’Neale trade in offseason)\n\nJarred Vanderbilt to BKN\nDayRon Sharpe, Kessler Edwards, 2027 PHI 1st top 8 protected\n\nBreakdown\n\nDayRon Sharpe, 1 year in, 29th pick, traditional big, kind of an unknown (570 minutes)\nKessler Edwards, 1 year in, 44th pick, 6-8 wing, good shooter, not a ton else\n\nMostly this trade is about the pick Edwards\n\nMany have circled Embiid as a guy to ask out; Harden is talking about going back to HOU; pick could be pretty decent\nEdwards is a type who could flourish into a nice backup forward\n\nIn a vacuum, I probably do this; I would prefer other deals but I’m low on Vando’s fit with Kessler\n\nTrade #2\n\nUTA & MEM\n\nDanny Green, filler, and a pick to UTA\nMalik Beasley to MEM\n\nBreakdown\n\nDanny Green fully guarantee on Jan 10, UFA next season\nFiller is likely a young player with some promise but non of MEM top 8\nPick is likely MEM own, protected somehow\n\nMostly this trade is about freeing up more cap space next year and getting a pick\n\nNext year’s class has guys like Grant, Porzingis, VanVleet\n\nTo me, this doesn’t make enough sense;\n\nBeasley is a piece you keep, IMO; you’ll need his skillset anyways and is unlikely to lose any value anytime soon\nSomeone bulls you over? Sure, but not for this deal IMO\n\n\nTrade #3\n\nUTA & GSW\n\nKelly Olynyk to GSW\nJames Wiseman + filler (discussed 2-1s) to UTA\n\nBreakdown\n\nWiseman #2 pick, hardly any playing time between high school, college, NBA, and G-League\nShows flashes\nThe other guy isn’t likely to have any value (not a core piece to GSW)\n\nBasically this trade is about buying crazy low on a former top pick\n\nIn theory, this is the type of thing teams in our position gotta do\n\nI wouldn’t do this trade, though. I think it’s very important for Utah to follow a LAC model at C\n\nTraditional rim protector for 30 mins a night and 5-out able the rest of the time\n\n\nTrade #4\n\nUTA & NOP\n\nMalik Beasley to NOP\n2025 MIL pick + filler\n\nThe filler was never much talked about but probably includes a combo of Garrett Temple, Devonte’ Graham, Jaxon Hayes, Kira Lewis Jr.\n2025 pick probably ages out Brook Lopez maybe Middleton leaves; still I think it’s in the 20’s\n\n\nBasically again it’s parts and a late pic\n\nAs is, I’m not doing it, again because I believe at 25 Malik fits Kessler, Markkanen, and new draft picks\nBut, if it was Dyson Daniels or Trey Murphy III and parts (no pick), yes I’d do it in a heartbeat"

    "text": "Markkanen Is an All-Star\nMarkkanen will be an All-Star this year; it’s done, IMO, and I’ll tell you why\n\nHis line is absurd: 24.5 pts, 8.4 rbs, 1.9 ast, 1.8 tov on +9.6% rTS\n\nJust take the pts, rbs, ast line adjusted worst by 10%\n14 player seasons before this year did it: 12 made the All-Star game\n\nDan Issel did it on +4.0% rTS (0.327 win rate by All-Star)\nAntawn Jamison did it on +0.5% rTS (0.207 win rate by All-Star)\n\nJazz are 0.487 win rate\n\nHe’s in the elite tier of efficiency\n\nOnly Jokic and Durant have a better TS% than Markkanen with more than 16.5 TSA/game\nGuys right behind him? Curry, Davis, Williamson, Embiid…all All-Stars\n\nUtah Jazz are hosting in SLC\n\nOver the past 25 All-Star games in cities with a host NBA team, 17 had at least one representative\nTeams/years that didn’t?\n\nAtlanta in 2021: 0.444 win rate at All-Star break\nChicago in 2020: 0.345\nLos Angeles in 2018: 0.469\nDenver in 2005: 0.453\nAtlanta in 2003: 0.388\nWashington DC in 2001: 0.245\nGolden State in 2000: 0.255\nNew York in 1998: 0.543\n\nThese teams didh’t have a guy like Markkanen and many were dumpster fire\n\nBarring big trades, Jazz are likely above 0.500 by the break"
