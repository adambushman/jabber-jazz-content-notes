Consider...\n\n*   Subscribing\n*   Following\n*   Leaving a review or comment\n*   Snagging some merch\n\n\n## Trader Danny's Dilemma\n\nJazz at 10-5, with every win, approach decision time more, more quickly:\n\n*   FiveThirtyEight projects #7 odds is 36 wins: Jazz need to go 0.388 rest of the way\n*   FiveThirtyEight projects #14 odds is 41 wins: Jazz need to go 0.462 rest of the way\n\n3 Options Danny & FO have to weigh:\n\n*   Trade the vets, hit the tank\n*   Steady as she goes\n*   Make a move to chase contention\n\n\n### Trade the vets, hit the tank\n\nConcerns:\n\n*   Vibes are good; does that create issues culturally?\n    -   Conley wants to stay, not uproot his family\n    -   Clarkson has become the cultural icon of the franchise\n    -   Markkanen's talked about \"the noise\"\n*   Are there deals to be made?\n    -   Issues in the offseason with Conley's partial guarantee\n    -   Sure, reported markets for Clarkson, Beasley...but for positive value? Assets?\n    -   Most of the time, takes a while to make deals: eligibility dates, etc.\n*   Other considerations\n    -   Finances\n    -   Fanbase excitement\n    -   All-Star game\n\n### Steady as she goes\n\nConcerns:\n\n*   We aren't really a contender\n    -   No real #1 guy\n    -   Lack of rim deterrence\n    -   Scouting is catching up; book on the Jazz is getting out\n    -   Injuries are inevitable (Conley)\n*   Middle-class bound\n    -   Jazz are often outside of the contender class but rarely first in line for top, incoming talent\n\n\nMost likely outcome:\n\n*   Main goal was figuring out what the Jazz have; there's still some work to do there\n*   MIN being toxic, BKN being combustible, and PHI being jekyll & hyde gives the impression there's enough in the aggregate\n*   A lot of equity with the organization and fanbase by letting it ride out\n\n\n### Make a move to chase contention\n\nConcerns:\n\n*   Jazz have all the mid-tier guys; \"upgrade\" is going to take a great player\n    -   Who out there is available?\n*   Who fits the bill\n    -   Kevin Durant\n    -   Luka Doncic\n    -   Most will require a trade request\n*   Can the Jazz execute fast enough?\n    -   Deals at the deadline are for NEXT season\n\n\n\n## Upgrade Idea\n\nWhat to look for in an \"upgrade\"?\n\n*   Under contract for a while\n*   Playoff and maybe Finals experience\n*   History as a top 15 guy\n*   Fits the team's culture/identity\n*   Addresses areas of weakness and fits positionally\n*   Is actually available\n\nTo me, that's Jimmy Butler!\n\nThe trade:\n\n*   Butler -> UTA\n*    Sexton, Beasley, ~4 1st picks (2 unprotected) -> MIA\n    -   MIA: comfortably below tax this year, potentially get out of tax next year'\n        *   MIA is disappointing this year: \n        *   Bill Simmons Pod: are the Heat done?\n            -   7-7 record; eeked out win over PHX; Bam/Lowry hot and cold\n        *   Jimmy's not \"available\", just as Gobert wasn't\n    -   UTA: stays just below the tax this year\n    -   Other ways to change slightly with players and picks\n\nWhy does Jimmy make sense?\n\n*   Under contract for 3 more years; suddenly you have a 3 yr window\n    -   By 2026 offseason (UTA-CLE-MIN swap year), Jazz transition again to new era\n*   Playoff & Finals experience\n    -   97 career games\n*   History of a top 15 guy\n    -   SI Top 100: last year ranked 11, this year ranked 10\n    -   Averaging 21 pts, 6 rbs, 6 ast on +0.3 rTS; 18 TSA/gm (Lauri is at 14, by comparison; Doncic at 25)\n*   Fits the team's culture/identity\n    -   Elite scorer: consistently positive rTS%\n    -   Elite play maker: +25 AST% past four seasons (Conley career avg: 29%)\n    -   Terrific size and perimeter defense\n        *   Active rebounder and disruptor\n    -   He's always about going hard, extra, etc.\n*   Addresses areas of weakness and fits positionally\n    -   Slots into the starting 2 spot\n    -   Mid-range scoring (need in playoffs) and gets to the line\n    -   Rotation: \n        *   Starters: Conley, Butler, Markkanen, Vanderbilt, Olynyk\n        *   Bench: Horton-Tucker, Clarkson, Gay, Kessler\n*   Is actually available\n    -   MIA has started super slow and disappointed\n    -   Committed to Bam & Herro\n    -   In MIA, with picks and cap space, they can get anyone\n        *   2024 offseason after Lowry is gone, they could sign or trade for a ton of amazing players\n\nThere's absolutely risks with such a deal.\n\nUTA discovered they have a #2 and a handful of #3-#4 options post-Rudy/Don trades.\n\nJazz can make this deal and still be positive in draft capital.\n\n\n## 5 Luke-warm Takes\n\nHot takes are a bit overrated.\n\nUltimately a good opportunity to share stuff on my mind!\n\n1.    Kessler needs ~22 mpg\n      *   Hardy has him at 15 minutes\n      *   Olynyk is really good but...\n      *   Kessler has earned more time\n      *   Kessler is impacting the game at a high level and addresses unique weaknesses\n2.    Collin's a better player than 3rd year Sexton\n      *   We (including me) talk about Collin getting back to that level\n      *   But we don't want that production with those habits\n      *   I'd prefer this production with better habits\n          -   Better discipline defensively\n          -   This approach to efficiency (FTAr & 3PAr)\n          -   This activity on the glass\n          -   This accountability\n      *   It's still not great but he's developing better process\n3.    The collective approach offensively works in the regular season but not the playoffs\n      *   Our top player (Lauri) is far below the usage of other stars\n      *   This distribution of offensive role, efficiency, etc. is really difficult to beat\n          -   Any given night anyone can produce\n          -   Limited scouting reports & preparation\n              *   Saw this in the PHI & WAS games; scouting can blow up a team of a lot of \"good\"\n      *   Come playoffs, that model doesn't work\n          -   Sure, you need good guys to punish loading up on the star\n          -   But with playoff prep, switching defenses, you need the star who can handle high usage and punish good matchups\n      *   That's what spells trouble for Utah\n          -   Likely playoff matchups\n              *   DAL: Luka\n              *   PHX: Booker\n              *   DEN: Jokic\n4.    The opponent 3P shooting isn't THAT crazy\n      *   Zach Lowe has talked about it a few times on his podcast\n      *   Last year's league low was 33.9% (Jazz currently at 32.5%)\n          -   Opponents make 6 more 3's, Jazz are at last year's low\n          -   Someone has to be the best team and so far it's not blatantly out of the ordinary\n      *   Some data points to evaluate process\n              *   Jazz are allowing the lowest opponent frequency\n              *   Jazz allowing the 2nd fewest corner 3's (the one's you want)\n              *   Jazz allowing the fewest C&S 3's (those are the ones you want)\n              *   Jazz allowing the 3rd fewest WIDE open 3's (6+ ft of space)\n      *   Opponent 3P talent?? (past 3 year efficiency/volume data)\n          -   Bottom 10: HOU, HOU, MEM, MEM, LAL, LAL, DAL, WAS\n              *   Stroked against us? DEN, MEM, LAL\n          -   Middle 10: DEN, DEN, ATL, PHI\n          -   Top 10: MIN, NOP, LAC\n      *   Upcoming??\n          -   NYK: 15th\n          -   PHX: 19th\n          -   POR: 14th\n      *   Jazz?? 8th in shooting talent\n5.    Our starting lineup is fun but it's only average\n      *   Think about it: no star, lots of good, modern style\n      *   CTG: top lineups (100+ minutes)\n          -   NBA best? Embiid + Maxey + PHI, no Harden: +33.4\n          -   NBA worst? George + LAC, no Leonard: -30.5\n          -   Jazz single lineup?\n              *   Starters: Conley-Clarkson-Markkanen-Vanderbilt-Olynyk\n              *   -0.1, 38%tile, 280 possessions\n\n\n## Close\n\nThanks for listening!\n\nLike what we're doing?
