Consider...\n\n*   Subscribing\n*   Following\n*   Leaving a review or comment\n*   Snagging some merch\n\n\n## Surprises thus far\n\n*   Chemistry of the team\n    -   Returning faces from last year's rotation: Conley, Clarkson, Gay\n    -   Returning coaching staff: Jensen, Skeeter\n    -   Given such turnover, didn't expect to see such cohesion\n        *   Top 5 in assists\n        *   13th in defense (CTG)\n        *   #6 in clutch NRTG (min 10 total minutes)\n*   Shooting performance\n    -   Despite shooting talent, we've seen REALLY good luck\n        *   Only 1 game where UTA 3PAs where fewer than their opponent\n        *   Only 2 games where UTA 3P% was less than their opponent\n    -   Without that kind of luck, we're looking more at a more realistic 3-4 record\n*   \"On the Same Page\"\n    -   #6 in smart shot freq advantage\n    -   They've discovered some hierarchy and roles\n            \n## Interesting stats from key rotation members\n\nDisclaimer: super small size theater\n\nWe'll try to stay away from inherently flawed stats as well\n\n*   Lauri Markkanen\n    -   Adjusted TSA/gm: +9.8 (last year +3.4)\n    -   Adjusted TS%: -0.1% (last year +1.6%)\n    -   Similar efficiency on increased volume? Heck yeah!\n        *   27% on 3's while previous 1000 attempts resulted in 37%\n*   Mike Conley\n    -   Seems far more active defensively\n        *   STL per 36: 1.6 (last year 1.7)\n        *   DEFLECtIONS per 36: 2.4 (last year 2.6)\n*   Jordan Clarkson\n    -   Really prone to pass this season; has his eyes out and looking to playmake\n    -   Potential assists per 36: 9.9 (last year 5.7)\n*   Kelly Olynyk\n    -   Putting together a similar start as he did in HOU, his best stretch ever\n        *   HOU: 21.7 pts, 9.6 rbs, 4.7 ast, +10.2% per 75 poss\n        *   UTA: 17.5 pts, 5.3 rbs, 4.7 ast, +13.8% per 75 poss\n*   Malik Beasley\n    -   Malik hit that game sealing 3 against Memphis but...\n        *   Efficiency: 35.5% on C&S (down from 38.1%)\n        *   Volume: 44.9% of shots as C&S3 (down from 60.4% last year)\n*   Jarred Vanderbilt\n    -   6.4 fouls per 75 possessions; leading the league (min 100 minutes played)\n    -   Fouled out of 2 games this year; 3 games where playing time seriously affected\n    -   Has to get that under control (last two games have been better: 2 & 3 fouls respectively)\n*   Collin Sexton\n    -   Big question: where is he realtive to 20-21?\n        *   He's not there from a volume/role standpoint\n    -   But what about rates?\n        *   CLE: 25.5 pts, 3.3 rbs, 4.6 ast, +0.1% per 75 poss\n        *   UTA: 22.9 pts, 5.4 rbs, 3.5 ast, +3.1% per 75 poss\n*   Rudy Gay\n    -   Much was made of Gay being unhappy last year\n        *   But it appears his attitude is improving despite...\n            -   USG: 16.5 (down from 19.3 last year)\n            -   Min/gm: 16.8 (down from 18.9 last year)\n*   Talen Horton-Tucker\n    -   Rough, rough efficiency thus far: -12.5 rTS%\n        *   Not a ton of reasons his game should ever translate to league average efficiency\n*   Walker Kessler\n    -   Creating significant issues for defenses at the rim\n        *   Opponent Rim Freq: 32% w/o Kessler (38% w/)\n        *   Opponent Rim FG%: 64% w/o Kessler (52% w/)\n\n\n## Close\n\nThanks for listening!\n\nLike what we're doing?
