real improvement would've cost those far out picks \n\n### Scenario 2: Rudy trade\n\n![Scenario 2](scenario-2-02.jpg)\n\n9 Man Rotation: \n\n*   Starters: Conley, Mitchell, Bogdanovic, Vanderbilt, ?\n*   Next 4: Clarkson, Beasley, Gay, Kessler\n\nOther Figures:\n\n*   Unprotected 1sts: 9 (assuming OKC conveys)\n*   Protected 1sts: 2\n*   Median Age: 27\n*   '23-'24 Guaranteed Roster Count: 7\n*   '23-'24 Guaranteed Salary vs Cap: 59%\n\nQuestions:\n\n*   How does this team play offensively?\n    -   Depends on the C; they go after Kelly, we see a lot of PnR and PnP\n    -   Pretty prolific offensively\n    -   Don't anticipate a rolling big with Vando\n*   How does this team play defensively?\n    -   They probably are trying to lean into that caos but they're average best case scenario\n*   How fun is this group?\n    -   Pretty prolific offensively\n    -   Definitely would've been good and deep, with assets to improve\n*   What's the immediate ceiling?\n    -   Competitive in 1st round, likely not exiting the 2nd\n*   What's the contender window for this squad?\n    -   Depends on Mitchell-Hardy; no Gobert means Don is happier\n    -   Still is probably only 2 years\n*   How optimistic are you for the future?\n    -   Jazz have a ton of guard depth and shooting; ideally you snag a John Collins type with the extra assets\n    -   Reasonably optimistic that we're getting younger and more flexible\n\n### Scenario 3: Donovan trade\n\n![Scenario 3](scenario-3-02.jpg)\n\n9 Man Rotation: \n\n*   Starters: Conley, Clarkson, Bogdanovic, Markkanen, Gobert\n*   Next 4: Sexton, ?, Gay, ?\n\nOther Figures:\n\n*   Unprotected 1sts: 9 (assuming OKC conveys)\n*   Protected 1sts: 1\n*   Median Age: 29\n*   '23-'24 Guaranteed Roster Count: 8\n*   '23-'24 Guaranteed Salary vs Cap: 87%\n\nQuestions:\n\n*   How does this team play offensively?\n    -   A ton of spread PnR with good shooters\n    -   I don't think Lauri is quite as unlocked via cuts with Gobert in the middle\n    -   Still very efficient and potent\n*   How does this team play defensively?\n    -   Secondary rim protection was always missing since Favors\n    -   Not quick at all on the perimeter\n*   How fun is this group?\n    -   I think this group is really fun; no Don-Rudy hanging over everything\n    -   Rudy would've stayed as long as we wanted\n*   What's the immediate ceiling?\n    -   Because *this* version of Lauri isn't a #1, volume scorer, you're looking at competitive first round only\n*   What's the contender window for this squad?\n    -   You realistically have 2-3 years, rest of Gobert's prime and contract\n*   How optimistic are you for the future?\n    -   Not all that confident; Jazz are still *too* old\n    -   Jazz would've been forced to execute another star trade (Butler?) immediately\n        *   Depth compromised\n\n### Scenario 4: Full blowup\n\n![Scenario 4](scenario-4-02.jpg)\n\n9 Man Rotation: \n\n*   Starters: Conley, Clarkson, Markkanen, Vanderbilt, Olynyk\n*   Next 4: Sexton, Beasley, Gay, Kessler\n\nOther Figures:\n\n*   Unprotected 1sts: 12 (assuming OKC conveys)\n*   Protected 1sts: 2\n*   Median Age: 26\n*   '23-'24 Guaranteed Roster Count: 7\n*   '23-'24 Guaranteed Salary vs Cap: 58%\n\nQuestions:\n\n*   What's the immediate ceiling?\n    -   Competitive in the first round\n*   What's the contender window for this squad?\n    -   Because of Lauri(25) and Kessler(21), there's nearly a decade if the Jazz play it right\n*   How optimistic are you for the future?\n    -   Pretty optimistic though true contention requires a #1, a top 10-15 player\n        *   We don't have one\n\n\n### Conclusion\n\n![Scenario Comp](scenario-comparison.jpg)\n\nWhich direction did you want at the time? Why?\n\n*   I wanted #1 or #2\n    -   It either works with two top 20 players excelling on either side of the ball or not\n\nWhich direction would you choose now with perfect hindsight? Why?\n\n*   Either #2 or #4\n    -   Hardy has been that impressive with his relationships; could've done wonders for Donovan\n    -   Still concern over Don bolting\n\n\n## Close\n\nThanks for listening!\n\nLike what we're doing?
