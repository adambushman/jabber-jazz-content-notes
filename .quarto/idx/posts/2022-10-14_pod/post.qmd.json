Consider...\n\n*   Subscribing\n*   Following\n*   Leaving a review or comment\n*   Snagging some merch\n\n\n## Roster moves\n\n*   Saben Lee cut from Jazz\n*   Micah Potter signed to two-way\n*   Darryl Morsell signed, then released\n*   Jeenathan Williams signed (summer league UJ participant)\n\nSome of these peripheral moves have no bearing on the regular season roster. Mostly just maneauvering so the team gets control and can have them participate on the Salt Lake City Stars.\n\nWho else is slotted to get cut?\n\n*   Udoka Azubuike still hasn't debuted in the preseason\n*   Jared Butler just hasn't looked good outside of the scrimmage (saw how well that worked for Lee)\n*   I think NAW stays and I'm coming around a bit\n*   Don't know about that final one\n\n## Projections & defining success\n\nProjections:\n\n*   Draft Kings: 24.5 (5th highest lotto odds)\n*   Hardwood Knocks: 25 (5th highest lotto odds)\n*   ESPN: 34.9 (6th highest lotto odds)\n*   Tankathon: (5th highest lotto odds)\n\nBest guess is we land in the 3-7 range. Does that match expectations for a successful season?\n\nHow should we define success:\n\nLose a  bunch of games?\n\n![Probabilities](prob-to-win-lotto-comp.png)\n![Conspiracy](mark-tweet.png)\n![Draft Depth](tony-jones-tweet.png)\n\n![3 Franchise Guys](3-franchise-players.png)\n![5 Franchise Guys](5-franchise-players.png)\n\nCan't just be lose games.\n\nCan we balance:\n\n*   Developing winning habits\n*   Mentoring our young guys\n*   Lots of playing time for young guys\n*   See what we have\n*   Let Hardy make mistakes\n*   Still lose a lot of games\n\nI believe so and I believe that's the plan\n\n\n## Close\n\nThanks for listening!\n\nLike what we're doing?
