James and I get you ready as we count down the hours to Utah Jazz basketball once more. We dive into roster construction, rotation wrinkles, percolating story lines, and settle on some predictions.\n\n\nWelcome to Jabber Jazz | Fan-driven, Ad-free content on Utah Jazz basketball\n\nAdam Bushman [Twitter | @adam_bushman](https://www.twitter.com/adam_bushman)\n\nToday:\n\n*   Training camp check-in\n    -   Buy, sell, or hold on reports from camp\n*   Offseason in review\n    -   With the context we have now, what do we make of it all?\n\nLike what we're doing? Consider...\n\n*   Subscribing\n*   Following\n*   Leaving a review or comment\n*   Snagging some merch\n\n## Training camp check-in\n\nTraining camp, media day, preseason, etc.\n\nEveryone is at their apex of health, confidence, performance, vibes, etc. \n\nJust like new job: everything is rosey\n\nWhat do we BUY, SELL, HOLD??\n\n1.    Jazz are playing to win every game\n    -   From Tony Jones, Will Hardy, Justin Zanik \n    -   Buy...coaching staff, players\n        -   Most players just aren't going to not do their best\n    -   Sell...front office\n        -   They need info, vets and youngins\n        -   Upon more info, I think they pick a direction\n        \nBrian Windhorst on The Bill Simmons Pod:\n\"I keep laughing out loud every time Danny Ainge or Justin Zanik, two people I respect, are acting like 'Oh, we're not tanking. We're still gonna try and compete'. Almost nothing that the Jazz have said publicly for 4 or 5 months has actually been true. 'We're going to build around Donovan', 'We don't need to trade Bogdanovic before camp', 'We've got good veterans, we're going to try and win these games'. Don't judge their words, judge their actions.\"\n        \n2.    Vets will play\n    -   Buy\n        -   Jazz traded one vet (Bogey) for another vet (Olynyk) to better compliment the roster\n        -   Balance and the right ecosystem for development is what's being considered\n            -   Bad examples: PHI, SAC\n3.    Malik is shooting the heck out of the ball\n    -   Buy\n        -   38% shooter last 1,000 attempts\n        -   38% - 41% Catch and Shoot\n        -   36% - 38% Pullup\n4.    Sexton playing both ends (O and D) every night\n    -   Sexton, Hardy comments\n    -   Sell\n        -   Jazz aren't going to sub him out for every defensive possession so \"technically\" he'll play\n        -   Selling on him being a contributor/average defensively\n5.    Energy and vibe around team\n    -   Tony Jones, Sexton, Clarkson\n    -   Buy!\n        -   Hardy and Sexton big drivers\n        -   Clarkson and Conley accentuating new culture\n        -   We're seeing it in every video/photo\n        -   Sarah Todd's article: worst vibes last year\n6.    Kessler \"leaps and bounds ahead\"\n    -   Conley via Todd's article\n    -   Buy\n        -   Very cerebral\n        -   Super impressed by his logic and preparation\n\n## Offseason in review\n\nTimeline of moves!\n\n![Timeline](timeline_viz.jpg)\n\n1.
