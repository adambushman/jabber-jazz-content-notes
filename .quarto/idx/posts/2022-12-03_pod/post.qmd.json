Consider...\n\n*   Subscribing\n*   Following\n*   Leaving a review or comment\n*   Snagging some merch\n\n\n\n## Team strengths & weaknesses\n\nJazz are 14-11; big win streaks, big losing streaks; what is this team?\n\nStrengths:\n\n*   We're exceptional offensively: 4th in NBA. How?\n    -   Great shot advantage team: \n        *   3rd largest 3P advantage (T3PA - O3PA)\n        *   5th largest SS advantage\n    -   Good shooting team:\n        *   4th in eFG% advantage\n        *   5th largest 3P% advantage \n    -   Fairly neutral on offensive possession swing\n        *   min(TOV) and max(OREB): 12th\n    -   We're good at transition but rarely get out\n    -   Our 5-out groups are special (no Vando, no Kessler)\n        *   565 poss, +9 diff (91%tile), 120.7 offense\n    -   It gets tough when we aren't 5-out but also lack interior size\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n*   We're pretty poor defensively: 26th\n    -   We defend the shot decent and we force bad shots generally\n        *   We're 24th in Rim Freq advantage\n    -   On defense, it's worst with possessions\n        *   max(TOV) and min(OREB): 26th\n    -   We can't stop or prevent opposing teams from running\n    -   We struggle with the teams with size in the middle\n        *   PHI, PHX, LAC\n\nTo be clear, IMO, we're a play-in team, sneak into playoffs if we keep at this all season long. That's not a contender. That's an invitation for Luka, Steph, Jokic, or Booker to wipe the floor with us in a 1-4, 2-4 series loss.\n\n\n## Trade potential for Utah\n\n*   Rumors [link](https://hoopshype.com/team/utah-jazz/)\n    -   Jazz want to trade Rudy Gay\n        *   This is a bit of \"no duh\"\n            -   Efficiency is awful (-12.7% rTS)\n            -   Minutes ahead of Fontecchio & Agbaji\n            -   Doesn't fit anything we're doing\n            -   Worst BPM of any player with 100+ minutes\n        *   Problems\n            -   Currently injured (finger)\n            -   Player option for next year ($6.5M)\n        *   Options\n            -   Just Gay? You're giving up a pick (no way you do that)\n            -   Bigger deal? He can be a concession for something\n            -   I don't know who'd even want him\n    -   Jazz interested in John Collins\n        *   Always made a lot of sense\n            -   Stretchy 4, can shoot, good on the glass, young (25), athletic\n            -   Discussed last couple years as available\n        *   Asking price\n            -   ATL asked for Markkanen...clearly that went no where\n            -   If that's the required cost, he's staying in ATL another trade deadline\n        *   Value I'd give up?\n            -   Clarkson + Gay + BKN 1st\n            -   ATL frees up some money since Clarkson will opt out; get another pick for flexibility\n            -   UTA takes on the 4 year contract for Collins\n    -   Jazz intent on keeping Clarkson, Markkanen; high price for Vanderbilt\n        *   Markkanen is obvious\n            -   Team control for two years after this one\n            -   Young (25)\n            -   Proving to be a great #2, possible All-Star this year\n            -   Your development project\n            -   Likely resign, max guy in 2025 offseason\n        *   Clarkson is nuanced\n            -   Cultural icon\n            -   Will stay if we want him\n            -   Will opt out and look for a 3 yr/$75M deal (19% of the cap)\n                *   Probably impossible to trade afterward; 31 upon signing\n            -   Has shown additional improvement, development (passing)\n            -   Value I'd give up\n                *   Mentioned the Collins trade\n                *   Clarkson + '25 pick for Cameron Johnson + Saric (or Crowder)\n                    -   Jazz extend Johnson (currently injured)\n                    -   Suns can extend Clarkson (perhaps clears way for Crowder)\n        *   Vanderbilt\n            -   Such an amazing contract ($4M this year and next) at only age 23\n            -   Will take an awesome offer\n            -   Value I'd give up\n                *   Vando + two-2nds for Jonathan Kuminga\n                *   Vando + one-2nd + swap rights with BKN pick (ie if BKN pick is better than GSW, they get it)\n*   Other ideas\n    -   I've floated Jimmy Butler as a move to go all-in on Markkanen being good right now\n        *   In a couple years, Markkanen is going to get $40M-$50M; that's 24-30% of the cap\n        *   If it's too late to tank and you believe in Hardy and this group, you almost owe it to yourself to do it right\n        *   Value I'd give up\n            -   Start with: Sexton-THT-NAW + middle '23 1st, '25 1st, '27 1st\n            -   Then try adding in another pick\n            -   Then try Sexton-Beasley-Gay + 3 picks\n    -   Deandre Ayton was available over the offseason, PHX matched IND offer, but he was always thought to eventually be on the move\n        *   He's been bad-ish this year; biggest issue is he lacks impact on the game\n        *   But he's 24, former #1 pick, locked up for 4 years at 25% of the cap, major cog for PHX getting to Finals\n        *   He's lacked volume (only 11.7 TSA/gm this year), he's lacked empowerment and trust (Hardy's calling card)\n        *   He's a #3 or a co-#2; have your frontcourt of the future\n        *   Value I'd give up\n            -   Olynyk + JC + Vando + two-1sts (BKN '23 and '25)\n            -   May feel like a lot but you gotta beat other offers and match what PHX needs now\n            -   JC is opting out, they may just move on from Olynyk so possibly two rentals\n        \n\n\n## 3 past team comparisons for this year's Jazz\n\nThese are facsimiles from NBA past that shed insights into what *could* be in store for the Jazz. They are stylistic comparisons.\n\nWe'll stay away from drawing exact conclusions and instead just consider them as potential future paths the franchise may traverse.\n\n### 2011-12 Denver Nuggets\n\nTimeline:\n\n*   Traded Carmelo Anthony -> NYK in the offseason\n    -   2 firsts, 2 seconds, 1 swap\n    -   Chandler, Mozgov, Felton, Gallinari, Koufos\n    -   Cash\n*   With a scrappy squad of no #1s, finished 6th and then 3rd in West\n*   Subsequent finishes\n    -   11th in West\n    -   12th in West\n*   Never completely bottomed out\n    -   Got lucky(?) with NYK being bad and turning into Jamal Murray\n    -   Got lucky with Jokic in the 2nd round\n    \nTakeaways:\n\n*   It's a cautionary tale of delaying the inevitable\n*   It's also a case of building and losing value because you bought into it\n\n### Post-Kawhi Spurs\n\nTimeline:\n\n*   Kawhi Leonard -> SAS in the offseason\n    -   Demar DeRozan, Jakob Poeltl, 1st\n*   Never tanked, until possibly this very season, yet...\n    -   2018\n        *   #18 - Lonnie Walker\n    -   2019\n        *   #19 - Luka Samanic\n        *   #29 - Keldon Johnson\n    -   2020\n        *   #11 - Devin Vassell\n    -   2021\n        *   #12 - Josh Primo\n    -   2022\n        *   #9 - Jeremy Sochan\n        *   #20 - Malachi Branham\n        *   #25 - Blake Wesley\n*   8 first round picks in 5 seasons\n    -   Lucky with Johnson\n    -   Unlucky with Primo\n    -   Potential with Vassell, Sochan\n    -   Rest are meh\n\nTakeaways:\n\n*   Jazz have 11 (minus 1) firsts in the next 5 seasons\n*   Goal of high picks is to avoid being dependent on other teams missing on prospects\n*   Spurs had a foundation but mid-picks never pushed them anywhere\n    -   Similarly, Jazz have a foundation but lack that star\n\n### 2013-14 Phoenix Suns\n\n*   Went 48-34 after a single bad year post-Steve Nash\n*   New coach in Jeff Hornacek\n*   Good mix of youth and veterans\n    -   Both Morris twins\n    -   5th year Goran Dragic\n    -   2nd year PJ Tucker\n    -   3rd year Eric Bledsoe\n*   Went on to have 6 straight losing seasons\n    -   Lot of good players came and went: \n        *   Seth Curry\n        *   TJ Warren\n        *   Reggie Bullock\n        *   Derrick Jones Jr.\n    -   Swings and misses\n        *   Marquisse Chriss\n        *   Dragan Bender\n        *   Josh Jackson\n\nTakeaways:\n\n*   PHX executed a transition and found some success but they lacked the super star\n*   Even after drafting him (Booker) they lacked the development around him\n*   They had bad luck (can happen, for sure)\n*   They've still achieved more post-Steve Nash than Utah has post-Stockton/Malone in less time\n    -   Always fun; heck no\n    -   Quantity vs quality game\n\n\n\n## Close\n\nThanks for listening!\n\nLike what we're doing?
